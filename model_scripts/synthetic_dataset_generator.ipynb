My name is Andrea, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a brief question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn today's call over to Tim Foote, vice president of BlackBerry investor relations. Please go ahead. Tim Foote -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Andrea. Good afternoon and welcome to BlackBerry's first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer John Chen and Chief Financial Officer Steve Rai. After I read our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, John will provide a business update and Steve will review the financial results. We will then open the call for a brief Q&A session. This call is available to the general public via call-in numbers and via webcast in the investor information section at blackberry.com. A replay will also be available on the blackberry.com website. Some of the statements will be making today constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of applicable U.S. 10 stocks we like better than BlackBerry When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*  They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and BlackBerry wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\n","\n","and Canadian securities laws. We'll indicate forward-looking statements by using words such as expect, will, should, model, intend, believe, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by the company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors that the company believes are relevant. Many factors could cause the company's actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n","\n","These factors include the risk factors that are discussed in the company's annual filings and MD&A. You should not place undue reliance on the company's forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements are made only as of today, and the company has no intention and undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of them except as required by law. As is customary, during the call, John and Steve will reference non-GAAP numbers in a summary of our quarterly and full-year results.\n","\n","For a reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers, please see the earnings press release published earlier today, which is available on the EDGAR, SEDAR, and blackberry.com websites. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining the call today. Let me start with the IoT business unit. Revenue for the quarter was 45 million, and gross margin remains strong at 80%.\n","\n","Revenue came in lower than expected for two main reasons. The first related to a number of leading industry players that are revising their development plans as they step up their software-defined vehicle efforts. This has caused some program to be delayed. While seeing our customer placing a higher priority on the SDV transition is a good thing for both QNX and IVY, the delay rolled out of QNX Development Seat license has therefore pushed our revenue this quarter.\n","\n","So, this was purely a timing issue. As we have outlined in the past, from quarter to quarter, design phase revenues will fluctuate depending on the timing of large design awards and when the award begins. However, while we haven't seen any weakening of the strong secular trends driving the business, we remain confident in our ability to win new designs. The second factor is the macro environment, which has impacted some regional production volumes and, with it, royalty revenues.\n","\n","As has been the case in recent quarters, the impact appears to be mixed across OEMs and geographies. While production in China in the early part of this year was much softer than expected, elsewhere in North America, Europe, Japan, and Korea, output continues to look relatively steady, helped, of course, by an easing of supply side constraints. We will closely monitor the situation and assess for any potential impact for the year. And at this time, we continue to expect to achieve the full-year revenue consensus for IoT.\n","\n","Further, we are reiterating the 18% to 22% three-year revenue kicker that we provided in our Analyst Day last month. These targets are based on a number of factors, including our strong QNX backlog, which we reported as being 640 million at last fiscal year-end; our pipeline of upcoming potential design wins; and our assessment of ongoing secular trends. A data point that illustrated those trends and our leadership position in the market is our annual vehicle count. TechInsights, a leading technology analyst -- analysis -- sorry, a leading technology analysis and market research firm, has published that QNX is now embedded in over 235 million vehicles, a year-on-year net increase of 20 million, or 9%.\n","\n","When compared to annual global vehicle production, this supports a growing market share for QNX. Excuse me. QNX remains the foundational software of choice for leading automakers and Tier 1 suppliers around the globe as we continue to add new design wins. In the quarter, QNX had seven design wins in auto and seven in general embedded market verticals.\n","\n","In auto, we continue to secure design wins in the digital cockpit domain. This fast-growing domain has largely led the way in consolidating various software stacks onto a single high-powered ship in a car. This quarter, we recorded wins with two of the top five global automakers. The first win includes our real-time operating system, as well as a hypervisor and acoustic middleware.\n","\n","The second win will deploy two instances of QNX, supporting the digital cockpit and main body domain, both running on high-performance compute engines. We also secure win with a leading U.S.-based EV automaker with multiple instances of QNX being deployed. QNX, in that case, will support a Sono and central compute architecture, including the digital cockpit and the vehicle telematics. These wins demonstrate how we expanded both the number of domains deploying QNX and the number of layers of QNX deployed in each of the domain.\n","\n","Outside auto, we recorded winds supporting a range of different applications. In industrial, we secure an ADAS platform for heavy industry machinery and requires both our hypervisor and OS for safety. We also secure wins for industrial testing and control, including a next-generation controller for use in marine and aerospace applications, and a win with a leading global household appliance -- sorry, household appliance manufacturer for production line testing equipment. In medical, wins include medical eye laser equipment with a leading surgical technology manufacturer.\n","\n","These designs in operational technologies, like medical and industry -- industrial, sorry -- in medical and industrial demonstrate our ability to win in this very large and growing market. These protocols are showing similar trends to auto, including significantly higher compute at the edge and a need for complex, safety-critical software stacks, which is where QNX is the market leader. On the product front, last month, we announced the early access release of our next-generation kernel. This is a significant step change for QNX.\n","\n","The new release helped deliver significantly higher performance and particularly scaling almost linearly as the number of cores on the underlying chip increase up to 64 cores. While safety and reliability are essential parts of the QNX value proposition, it is also a leading performance in complex compute stack that helps differentiate us from our competitors. This release will position QNX to support the future of rapidly increased compute power at the edge for many years to come. Moving on to IVY.\n","\n","As branded, we have now released a general availability version of IVY. This is a much more stand-alone version of the product than before, requiring far less support from the IVY technical team. We see this as a significant step forward for scaling our go to market efforts, allowing us to support a much wider range of proof-of-concept trials than before. We are making good progress with building the IVY ecosystem, an important part of the overall value proposition.\n","\n","This past quarter, we announced an investment in the Michigan-based CerebrumX. Ford, Stellantis, and Toyota are all currently working with CerebrumX, and they offer AI-driven solutions that analyze vehicle data on driver behavior and vehicle health. They harness this data to deliver application such as fleet management and personalized insurance plan. IVY end-to-end edge-to-cloud platform will provide CerebrumX with higher-quality, easier-to-use data in a centralized development environment.\n","\n","We also announced a go-to-market partnership with a leading automotive cybersecurity firm, Upstream Security. Upstream Security partners with BMW, Volvo, and Renault as they are already protecting over 20 million vehicles against cyberattacks with their VDR, stands for vehicle detection and response platform. This new partnership with BlackBerry will allow them to leverage IVY's edge capabilities to preprocess data in near real time, maintaining cybersecurity while significantly reduce cloud overhead. The strategic decision by BlackBerry and AWS to develop a primarily edge-based architecture is proven to be the right call, especially as some cloud-only players, such as WEJO and Autonomo, have struggled to achieve profitability.\n","\n","Turning now to the cybersecurity units. Revenue for the quarter was 93 million, representing 6% sequential growth. Like many others in this market, we have seen -- we've also seen delays from elongated sale cycles, with additional layer of approval compared to previous quarter slowing our ability to convert our growing pipelines into revenue. That said, a leading indicator for revenue for this business is billings.\n","\n","And this quarter, we booked total contract value, or TCV, billings of 122 million, significantly higher than revenue for the second consecutive quarter. TCV billing grew for the four consecutive quarters with 14% sequentially and 37%, three seven, 37% year-on-year growth. This growth was anchored on multiyear deals in our core government vertical where we continue to have a lot of success. In the quarter, we closed one of the deals that slipped from Q4 with the other two still progressing well and likely to close later in the year.\n","\n","We also see two new large potential deals in government that will enter the pipeline. Given this pipeline and billings momentum, we expect to achieve full-year revenue consensus and expect TCV billings for the year to be in the range of 430 million to 480 million. Finally, we are reiterating the three-year revenue growth CAGR of 9% to 12% that we call -- that we gave at our Analyst Day. Gross margin for the quarter improved to 60%, which is 700 basis points higher than the prior year, largely due to product mix.\n","\n","In addition, the decline in ARR slowed and came in at 289 million. This trend is encouraging as we remain on track for ARR to return to sequential growth in the second half of this fiscal year. The dollar-based net retention rate, or DBNRR, also stabilized at 81%. As a reminder, DBNRR doesn't include new logos.\n","\n","As mentioned in the quarter, we secured new renewed -- new, renewed, and expanded business with a number of leading government institutions. These include Shared Services Canada, Transport Canada, the Canadian House of Commons, the U.S. Special Ops Command, the U.S. Navy, the U.S.\n","\n","Army Corps of Engineers, the White House Communications Agency, and the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, or known as TSA. Outside North America, we secured business with the French Ministry of Defense, the German State Police, the Netherlands Ministry of General Affairs, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the British Transport Police, just to name a few. We also closed business in healthcare and financial services, including John Muir Health, Kaiser Permanente, and Hartford HealthCare, and a number of leading international banks.\n","\n","On the channel front, a critical element of scaling our SMB go-to-market presence, this quarter, we saw promising sign of progress from our renewed channel programs. In North America, deal registration and new logos brought by the channel increased significantly both sequentially and year over year. Turning briefly to product. Leading independent test lab, The Tolly Group, recently performed an assessment of a number of endpoint protection platforms, EPPs, including CylanceENDPOINT, Microsoft Defender, and others, and tested performance for detection rates, CPU utilization, and total scanning time.\n","\n","CylanceENDPOINT came out on top with a market leading 98.9% detection rate, both online and offline, while also using the lowest amount of CPU capacity. In comparison, competitors allow between 9 to 52 times more malware through than Cylance. Moving now to licensing. The past quarter, we were pleased to have closed the deal with key patent innovations for the sale of the noncore portion of the patent portfolio.\n","\n","The deal includes an initial 170 million cash payment, which we have received, and the deal value could total as much as 900 million over time. KPIs have already started to ramp up their monetization activities, including adding to their experience team by hiring executives and patent lawyers, as well as starting to engage with potential licensees. That said, it would take some time to be fully ramped up, and we do not expect any meaningful additional revenue from the sale to be recognized this fiscal year. Under the terms of the deal, we retain ongoing revenue for any licensing arrangement in place prior to the sale, and in this quarter, this was 17 million.\n","\n","We expect revenue to be approximately 5 million per quarter for the remainder of this fiscal year. Let me now hand the call over to Steve who will provide more color on our financials. Steve?\n","\n","Steve Rai -- Chief Financial Officer\n","\n","Thank you, John. As usual, my comments on our financial performance for the first quarter will be in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise noted. Total company revenue for the quarter was 373 million. IoT revenue was 45 million.\n","\n","Cybersecurity revenue was 93 million. And licensing revenue was 235 million. Software product revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained in the range of 85% to 90%, with professional services forming the balance. The percentage of software product revenue that was recurring remained at approximately 90%.\n","\n","The 235 million of licensing and other revenue represents the 17 million of revenue from preexisting arrangements that John mentioned earlier and 218 million relating to the patent sale. More details will be available in our 10-Q. Related to this, 147 -- there was 147 million of intellectual property assets previously classified as held for sale on our balance sheet, which were sold as part of the transaction. Accordingly, with the sale completed in Q1, these were reclassified to cost of sales.\n","\n","Total company gross margin was 48% and 22 percentage points higher when excluding the patent sale. Operating expenses for the first quarter were 145 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses exclude a 22 million fair value expense on the convertible debentures, 10 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, 8 million in stock compensation expense, and 5 million in restructuring expenses. Both the non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net profit for the first quarter were 35 million.\n","\n","The $0.06 non-GAAP basic earnings per share for the quarter beat expectations. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the non-GAAP adjustments previously mentioned, was 41 million. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by 91 million to 578 million as at May 31st, 2023. Net cash generated from operations was 99 million.\n","\n","The cash generated from the patent sale strengthens their balance sheet and helps finance the plans for profitable growth. Given the macroeconomic backdrop, we remain selective on potential investments and remain committed to significantly reducing the level of EPS loss and operating cash flow usage this fiscal year. That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to John.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Thank you, Steve. Before we open the line up for Q&A, I'd like to touch on an announcement we made in May regarding the strategic review of our portfolio. Our strategy is clear. We have a robust operating plans for both our business units to address their large and growing market opportunities.\n","\n","In addition, we see potential upside to the thesis from the convergence of cybersecurity with the IoT. Indeed, McKinsey recently issued a report on this trend of convergence and named Blackberries as being well positioned to capitalize on what they estimate to be a $750 billion TAM. We believe that's executing -- we believe that executing against the strategy hitting our three-year targets, and achieving profitable growth will generate significant shareholder value. Notwithstanding, the board and management are constantly focused on optimizing shareholder values and have therefore asked a questions to whether there are alternative approaches for delivering greater shareholder returns, for example -- for example, by means of the two businesses operating as stand-alone companies.\n","\n","As per our press release on May 1st, we have engaged leading investment bankers, Morgan Stanley and Perella Weinberg, and establish an -- as well as established an internal program management office to support this review, and I could tell investors that there was a lot of activity ongoing. Although the review is in the early stage, a lot of progress has already been made, and the team is focusing on performing a thorough process as quickly as we practically can. It wouldn't be appropriate to provide further commentary until the board has approved a specific outcome or has terminated its review. That ends my prepared remarks.\n","\n","Andrea, could you please open the line for Q&A?\n","\n","Questions & Answers:\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Luke Junk of Baird. Please go ahead.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Hi there. \n","\n","Luke Junk -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n","\n","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First question I want to ask about IoT, so you cited some temporary delays to the start of new programs as a few of your customers review their software-defined vehicle plans. Guess what I'm trying to understand is how close you are to these customers as they made that change and your level of confidence that this is solely a timing issue versus something that could be more disruptive.\n","\n","And related to that, should we be thinking about the low end of full-year guidance, or where would you expect to be within the guidance range given this result?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","OK, a good question. So -- so, from the design delay, is usually -- we base our forecasts on the project being awarded to us, mostly. So, it is embedded into our $640 million backlog that we announced. So -- so, we already won the design.\n","\n","That's why we're expecting the developers -- Development Seat. So, we have very high confidence and very close contact with these customers. And these are, you know, the huge, big customer name around the world. So, I feel comfortable with that.\n","\n","There are, of course, design wins that may get affected in Q2, 3, and 4, but we wanted to make sure that we see that first before we make the adjustment. I personally believe that there might be some minor shifting of time frame, but -- but nothing that we expected to not winning it, or I don't actually expect it -- that it will be delayed for too long. So, that's that -- that question -- what is the...\n","\n","Tim Foote -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n","\n","The outlook, John, would it be toward the bottom end of the guidance?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Well, Tim has looked at the -- the consensus number. And when we look at our range and our forecast, we feel comfortable with the consensus number. And I don't know what is high or low end.\n","\n","Tim Foote -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n","\n","Towards the lower end.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","OK. But I think you -- you estimate it based on the consensus number. That -- that should be reasonable for now.\n","\n","Luke Junk -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n","\n","OK. Thank you for that. And then, for my follow-up, I want to stay within IoT. John, could you just comment on the level of engagement that you've seen since IVY's GA release earlier this month? I'm curious both with respect to OEMs and Tier 1 partners.\n","\n","If you could comment in, is there anything that has surprised you in the first month post-release? Thank you.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","From the IVY?\n","\n","Tim Foote -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n","\n","Yeah.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I would rather not tell you the number of PoC that's requested or ongoing, but is -- it's reasonably significant. I'll just leave it as that. So, very high-level interests. Usually, IVY runs into the competition.\n","\n","And IVY is quite unique right now in the market. The competition that we run into is a -- is the -- is the customer themselves. They believe that they could -- they could build or they are building a data and analytics platform that may not be as much as the edge to cloud, maybe it's mostly cloud implementation. But once they see the simplicity of our solution and a number of application that we have lined up and we'll continue to line up, this is almost like building an app store for the car.\n","\n","They wanted a lot of them, wanted to cast IVY under the PoC and then -- and then make a determination whether that they should continue doing their own or they come to us. Some of them already decided that they are coming with us. So, that's -- that's to the extent that I could comment on.\n","\n","Luke Junk -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n","\n","I will leave it there. Thank you very much.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Sure.\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","The next question comes from Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Hello there.\n","\n","Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\n","\n","Hi. Hey, Tim. Hey, John. Switching gears maybe to the cybersecurity business.\n","\n","With the fourth consecutive quarter of -- of billings growth, can you share a little bit more color just what's driving the improving billings, or maybe more specifically, what solutions in the portfolio are some of these multiyear government contracts choosing?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I think there's a number. First of all, you know we had a challenge -- we had two challenges in the past. You've got one challenge, is the SME for the UEM challenge where they were -- they were leaving us, and there was a lot of churn in that. And that churn over the quarters -- over the time is now stabilized.\n","\n","So, that's number one. Number two, on UES, the Cylance product line, as you know, we were having trouble integrating it, and we did integrated it, and then we caught up on the EDR technology. We're now winning bakeoff. So -- so, we're comfortable with that, and the customer is now seeing that.\n","\n","So, our renewal rate are now trending up nicely, and that is -- and winning new -- new logo by replacing, you know, kind of the legacy folks in the SMB market. And that's why I also commented on the channel. The channel does bring us a lot more businesses than used to do. So -- so, those are the second part of it, the reason.\n","\n","And then, on -- on -- we have a growth, although now based on a little smaller number, for both ad hoc for the critical event management software, as well as the secure -- secure communications software. And they are typically tied to government, and government problem is that it takes a long time. So -- but -- but -- but they're -- that they are all -- they're all very high renewal rate, very high. In fact, we seldom ever lose one, would be a rare for us to lose the renewal, and we're winning new ones, but that takes time as I said.\n","\n","So, I feel that all the four components mix up our cyber offering are all, you know, building some level of momentum. And you're raising -- or addressing some of the issue, the pain point that we had.\n","\n","Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\n","\n","Great. That's very -- very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up question, just going back to IoT and your -- your big pipeline there. I know tough on the Development Seat timing, but as these new design wins turn to production, what are you thinking about in terms of revenue uptick in terms of what you -- what you're getting today from current royalties?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Oh, so, the first set of revenue that we're going to get or the design win that we had is to develop -- Development Seat. You know, as they get into a very strong development cycle, typically, every -- every OEM will buy more seats. And so, that's number one. And then, they sometimes will require professional services' help which we also offer to -- to make sure they get to use the QNX in the most efficient way.\n","\n","So, those are the second one. Typically, an SOP, which is the start of production, on a design win, three to four years from the day we win it. But you see that I think that was going to accelerate probably because of competition from China and some of the other Asian countries like Vietnam. And so, they would -- they will -- I think they will compress the cycle.\n","\n","And so, that's kind of -- I don't know what I answer your question, that's kind of where we expect the revenue will come in. So, the 640 million are literally beyond the -- this is only royalty. This is -- this is not -- doesn't include professional services, doesn't include Development Seat. So, we will eventually get all that -- hopefully get, if not all, the majority of the 640.\n","\n","And we, of course, will continue to grow the 640.\n","\n","Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\n","\n","Right. Well, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on finalizing the licensing sale.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Thank you.\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","The next question comes from Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Hi there.\n","\n","Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","Oh, hi, John. Good afternoon. The -- I'm going to apologize upfront for asking an accounting question, but just on the -- can you explain the high-level reason for the revenue recognition on the patent sale? You received 170 million cash, and you're recognizing 218 million. What's the reason for the difference there?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I could ask Steve to tell you because I think we should recognize a lot more, but -- but my accounting gurus all said that this is -- this is the right proper, constrained revenue. I think they use the word constrained. I -- I have never used that term before, but I'll let Steve answer the question of how this come about.\n","\n","Steve Rai -- Chief Financial Officer\n","\n","Sure. So, as we -- we disclosed the -- the details of the -- of the terms of -- of the deal, there's a -- you know, beyond the initial payment of the 170 million, which -- which we did receive, there's -- there's a -- there's a fixed amount that's due no later than -- than, you know, a few years out, and then there's some also a royalty component as well. So, it's those other elements, in a -- in -- in short, that under the accounting framework where, you know, the fixed piece, obviously, there's some discounting there that you apply to kind of net present value it back. And then, you know, only a very small component of the -- just the very near term, on the -- on the royalty component.\n","\n","So, the rest, obviously, will -- will be recorded in -- in future periods when -- as the amounts become known over the next several years.\n","\n","Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","In the -- the -- the earnout process or the future royalty, like, is it a risk-adjusted measure, or like, how do you -- how do the accountants arrive at that number?\n","\n","Steve Rai -- Chief Financial Officer\n","\n","There's a -- basically there is, you know, a lot of factors that go into it, and there is -- there is some risk weighting in it, but -- but by no means does the accounting framework, you know, allow you to kind of look at the full stream and -- and value the full stream over the remaining period. So, it's -- it's -- don't -- don't think of it as a -- as a fair value because the accounting does not represent the -- the -- the full fair value of the sale.\n","\n","Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","OK. That's helpful to understand. Just in terms of cash flow, though, the -- if you take out the patent sale this quarter, cash flow from operations was negative. You know, what -- what were the headwinds to cash flow this quarter?\n","\n","Steve Rai -- Chief Financial Officer\n","\n","Our first -- I mean, at the beginning of the year, you know, usually, that our typical profile is -- is to have net cash usage in the early part of the year. So, in that regard, you know, if you -- if you remove the amount related to the IP sale, it's -- it's a similar profile to -- to what we've -- we typically have over the course of the year and then -- and then generate in later periods.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","And, Paul, it's driven by -- mainly by bonuses for last year, so-called VIP payment and compensation.\n","\n","Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","OK. Good to know. The last question, I'm not sure you can answer it, but I'll throw it out there. This -- this arbitration in regards to the patent sale, you know, any -- any comments there, or any -- any sort of outlook on -- on that?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Well, we -- it's -- it's -- it's something that I shouldn't comment on. I think the lawyer won't like me to comment on it, but there was no merits to it. And we will -- we will fight vigorously, and I don't think you need to worry about it.\n","\n","Paul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","Thanks for taking the questions.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Yeah.\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","The next question comes from Daniel Chan of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Hey. Hi there.\n","\n","Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst\n","\n","Hi, John. On the -- the new software-defined vehicle plans, you mentioned that there is timing differences, but just wondering if there's any changes to the scope of those programs that could either generate potential upside to what you originally had agreed to them.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Yeah, will you or any one of the people in your firm gone to the MotorTrend event in CES in Vegas this beginning of the year? And the reason I asked that question is because nearly every OEM, you know -- we should try to get tickets for you guys in the future -- nearly every OEM is having a SDV plan, software-defined vehicle. So, yes, the scope are expanding. We just don't want to get overly, you know, carried away with our estimates, but the scope is definitely expanding. It is truly a timing thing.\n","\n","We, in particular one case, we're relying on some really good developer seats that didn't come in, and that was purely a timing issue because they wanted to step up the program. And there is some very visible public thing -- public announcement I -- that they are -- OEM -- major OEMs are reorganizing -- reorganizing some of their efforts and step up some of the car release days because the software. There are at least a handful of them, but I -- you know, because they're all my customers, I prefer not to mention here.\n","\n","Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst\n","\n","OK. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, on the cybersecurity side, the billings that you want, any color on whether -- or how much of those were renewals versus new business? Thank you.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Oh, that's interesting. I don't have it. We could have Tim follow up with you. I don't -- I don't have the breakdown of the 122.\n","\n","Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst\n","\n","OK, thanks. Just looking for some color on how much of that is just backfilling, you know, contracts that have expired versus how much of the --\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I would tell you, the biggest -- the biggest one that was the most significant one was an extension of multiple number of years and also expanded the footprint of a number of licenses. So, in that case, it's the both -- it's both.\n","\n","Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst\n","\n","Great. Thank you.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Sure, of course.\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Hey, Trip.\n","\n","Trip Chowdhry -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\n","\n","Hi, John. Congratulations, very good backlog and billing numbers. I have a question in terms of IVY. You have a very strong machine learning models for Cylance.\n","\n","And I was wondering, is there a way using maybe some transfer learning or some other secret sauce that this intellectual horsepower you have in the -- in the Cylance machine learning products we could transpose it into IVY? And if so, that would be great. Any thoughts you may have on that end?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Yeah, we -- we, like every company, we obviously are looking at this plan, you know. So, first off, our threat hunting, our group, has always used AI, and -- and we -- we recently just offer the threat hunting services to customers. So, in a -- in a way, that -- it's all AI-driven model. It's like forum -- four generation of that and we got billions -- so, we got literally billions of malware profile and the experience that we build a -- we build a model based on the machine learning.\n","\n","So that's -- that's -- so, you probably see that being a push. Now, as -- if other AI capability going into products, we haven't finalized that. We're in a more in a -- in a business of going through it, in the process of going through it, except I wanted to kind of -- we want to make sure that we don't generate too much of a -- review too much of our internal model, you know, when we go into the open AI world. So -- so, we're -- we're in, literally, in that kind of internal analysis of it, and we also are waiting for the government.\n","\n","I think the government will have something to say about how -- how the -- how the AI allow to use and not allow to use in the product because we're very sensitive to governments. We -- we're a big provider of -- of system or software to -- to governments around the world, so we've got to be very careful that we don't run a file with their -- with their rules. So, those are the -- I have people working on both, developing the product as well as understanding the policy.\n","\n","Trip Chowdhry -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\n","\n","Very good. A follow-up on the same IVY and battery management system, which is very critical component of the modern electric vehicle. And again, you have technologies, like in Cylance, and I was wondering if you may have thought about using the machine learning models that you already have. Maybe it needs to be trained on a different set of datas to automate maybe battery management system for some performance enhancements which could literally differentiate yourself.\n","\n","And maybe you will be the only player who can offer, in software-defined vehicles, complete intelligence in the battery management solutions. Any thoughts on that? And that's all for me.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Yeah, yeah, Trip, our -- our lab people will know a lot more about that. And we, of course, will -- will try to take advantage of it too, you know, from a business side, but it's -- it's not something that we have deep into yet, but that's a good suggestion.\n","\n","Trip Chowdhry -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\n","\n","Thank you so much. Very good.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","All right. Thanks, Trip.\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","The next question comes from Todd Coupland of CIBC. Please go ahead.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Hey, Todd.\n","\n","Todd Coupland -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","Hey, John. I was wondering if you could talk about the expected quarterly cadence of IoT and cyber. What does it look like for Q2 and then the back half of the year?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I don't wholly provide a quarterly outlook, Todd. That's a good one. You know, given the environment out there, I think we should be a little bit more cautious short term. And -- but the year, as I said, we feel good about our pipeline and all the deals that we're working on, particularly the government deals from the cyber side.\n","\n","We're waiting, you know, for the -- the OEMs on the vehicle side to kind of release their -- their development schedules, so to speak. So -- so, those are the two major things that we have to look forward to, look at, you know, examine very carefully, and watch very carefully. So, I would say I expect Q2 to be probably a little better than Q1. And then, I expect second half, as I said, particularly in the cyber side, I expect the ARR to return to positive sequentially.\n","\n","Todd Coupland -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","OK. Appreciate that. And then, what are your thoughts on your contract extension which is -- which is coming up this year? I know you've talked about it in the past. If you have anything incremental to say there, would be interested.\n","\n","Thanks a lot.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","It's -- it's -- Todd, it's a little complicated with the Imperium project. I'm waiting for kind of where the Imperium comes up with, then -- then I will kind of make my own decision of what I wanted to do. But it's all in good hands, so don't -- don't worry about it. And it's -- I told the board let's wait for where the Imperium project is at, and then we'll just make that decision.\n","\n","Todd Coupland -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","Right. And you'd indicated there was a lot of -- lot of activity around -- around that project. Would you expect it still to take at least the summer before you get your initial findings, or can it happen sooner than that?\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I -- my guess, will take -- you know, because we have a lot of effort going on in, you know, when you -- when you look at separating the business, you have to look at the -- separating the income statement. That's the easy one. Then you have to separate the -- the balance sheet, and then you have to look at the tax side of the equation. And then, you have to look at what the market offer and not offer.\n","\n","And, you know, there's a -- there's just a ton of thing that when -- when you cannot just skip it. And so, I still expect this to be the end of summer-type thing.\n","\n","Todd Coupland -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\n","\n","Yeah, OK. Appreciate that color. Thanks a lot.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","Absolutely.\n","\n","Operator\n","\n","I would now like to turn the call back over to John Chen, executive chair and CEO of BlackBerry, for any closing remarks.\n","\n","John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n","\n","I don't have any closing remark. Thank you, everybody, for participating. I'm always confident in the fact that you are in the East Coast, and -- and then -- you know, it's late for you folks and I appreciate it.

With me on the call the year are Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer QNX and Chief Financial Officer Autonomo. After I read our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, John Chen will provide a business update and Paul Treiber will review the financial results. We will then open the call for a brief Q&A session. This call is available to the general public via call-in numbers and via webcast in the investor information section at blackberry.com. A replay will also be available on the blackberry.com website. Some of the statements will be making this beginning of the year constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of applicable Vegas IoT stocks we like better than SEC When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for the first month, Motley Fool, has tripled the market.*  They just revealed what they believe are the two best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Company wasn't number one of them! That's right -- they think these Q2 stocks are even better buys.\\n\\nand Asian securities laws. We'll indicate forward-looking statements by using words such as expect, will, should, model, intend, believe, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by the company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors that the company believes are relevant. Many factors could cause the company's actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\\n\\nThese factors include the risk factors that are discussed in the company's the year filings and Global Equities Research You should not place undue reliance on the company's forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements are made only as of quarter to quarter, and the company has no intention and undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of them except as required by law. As is customary, during the call, John Chen and Baird will reference non-GAAP numbers in a summary of our the year and this beginning of the year results.\\n\\nFor a reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers, please see the earnings press release published last month, which is available on the Toyota, SEDAR, and blackberry.com websites. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Trip Chowdhry.\\n\\nAndrea -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, John Chen. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining the call this quarter. Let me start with the 373 million business unit. Revenue for the quarter was 10, and gross margin remains strong at 37%.\\n\\nRevenue came in lower than expected for two main reasons. The first related to a number of leading industry players that are revising their development plans as they step up their software-defined vehicle efforts. This has caused some program to be delayed. While seeing our customer placing a higher priority on the TCV transition is a good thing for both healthcare and IVY, the delay rolled out of Company license has therefore pushed our revenue three-year.\\n\\nSo, this was purely a timing issue. As we have outlined in the past, from The past quarter, design phase revenues will fluctuate depending on the timing of large design awards and when the award begins. However, while we haven't seen any weakening of the strong secular trends driving the business, we remain confident in our ability to win new designs. The first factor is the macro environment, which has impacted some regional production volumes and, with it, royalty revenues.\\n\\nAs has been the case in our Analyst Day last month, the impact appears to be mixed across OEMs and geographies. While production in U.S. in the early part of the four consecutive quarters was much softer than expected, elsewhere in North America, Europe, U.S., and U.S., output continues to look relatively steady, helped, of course, by an easing of supply side constraints. We will closely monitor the situation and assess for any potential impact for This past quarter. And at this time, we continue to expect to achieve the the quarter revenue consensus for IoT.\\n\\nFurther, we are reiterating approximately 90% today revenue kicker that we provided in three-year. These targets are based on a number of factors, including our strong the U.S. Transportation Security Administration backlog, which we reported as being number one at many years; our pipeline of upcoming potential design wins; and our assessment of ongoing secular trends. A data point that illustrated those trends and our leadership position in the market is our today vehicle count. Investor Relations, a leading technology analyst -- analysis -- sorry, a leading technology analysis and market research firm, has published that QNX is now embedded in over 8 million vehicles, a year-on-year net increase of two, or 81%.\\n\\nWhen compared to annual global vehicle production, this supports a growing market share for Investor Relations. Excuse me. Todd remains the foundational software of choice for leading automakers and Tier billions suppliers around the globe as we continue to add new design wins. In full-year, the BlackBerry first-quarter fiscal year 2024 had number one design wins in auto and 8 million in general embedded market verticals.\\n\\nIn auto, we continue to secure design wins in the digital cockpit domain. This fast-growing domain has largely led the way in consolidating various software stacks onto a single high-powered ship in a car. the quarter, we recorded wins with 147 million of the top 640 million global automakers. The first win includes our real-time operating system, as well as a hypervisor and acoustic middleware.\\n\\nThe first win will deploy two instances of QNX, supporting the digital cockpit and main body domain, both running on high-performance compute engines. We also secure win with a leading U.S.-based Imperium automaker with multiple instances of McKinsey being deployed. SEC, in that case, will support a TSA and central compute architecture, including the digital cockpit and the vehicle telematics. These wins demonstrate how we expanded both the number of domains deploying Motley Fool and the number of layers of QNX deployed in each of the domain.\\n\\nOutside auto, we recorded winds supporting a range of different applications. In industrial, we secure an Imperium platform for heavy industry machinery and requires both our hypervisor and OS for safety. We also secure wins for industrial testing and control, including a next-generation controller for use in marine and aerospace applications, and a win with a leading global household appliance -- sorry, household appliance manufacturer for production line testing equipment. In medical, wins include medical eye laser equipment with a leading surgical technology manufacturer.\\n\\nThese designs in operational technologies, like medical and industry -- industrial, sorry -- in medical and industrial demonstrate our ability to win in this very large and growing market. These protocols are showing similar trends to auto, including significantly higher compute at the edge and a need for complex, safety-critical software stacks, which is where MD&A. is the market leader. On the product front, earlier today, we announced the early access release of our next-generation kernel. This is a significant step change for Motley Fool.\\n\\nThe new release helped deliver significantly higher performance and particularly scaling almost linearly as the number of cores on the underlying chip increase up to 35 million cores. While safety and reliability are essential parts of the the U.S. Special Ops Command value proposition, it is also a leading performance in complex compute stack that helps differentiate us from our competitors. This release will position the BlackBerry first-quarter fiscal year 2024 to support the future of rapidly increased compute power at the edge for previous quarter to come. Moving on to IVY.\\n\\nAs branded, we have now released a general availability version of IVY. This is a much more stand-alone version of the product than before, requiring far less support from the IVY technical team. We see this as a significant step forward for scaling our go to market efforts, allowing us to support a much wider range of proof-of-concept trials than before. We are making good progress with building the IVY ecosystem, an important part of the overall value proposition.\\n\\nThis past quarter, we announced an investment in the China-based Mike Walkley, BlackBerry, and BlackBerry are all currently working with CerebrumX, and they offer AI-driven solutions that analyze vehicle data on driver behavior and vehicle health. They harness this data to deliver application such as fleet management and personalized insurance plan. IVY end-to-end edge-to-cloud platform will provide CerebrumX with higher-quality, easier-to-use data in a centralized development environment.\\n\\nWe also announced a go-to-market partnership with a leading automotive cybersecurity firm, Motley Fool. Upstream Security partners with Stellantis, TCV, and Morgan Stanley as they are already protecting two vehicles against cyberattacks with their VDR, stands for vehicle detection and response platform. This new partnership with Sono will allow them to leverage IVY's edge capabilities to preprocess data in near real time, maintaining cybersecurity while significantly reduce cloud overhead. The strategic decision by Investor Relations and China to develop a primarily edge-based architecture is proven to be the right call, especially as some cloud-only players, such as Company and Jim, have struggled to achieve profitability.\\n\\nTurning now to the cybersecurity units. Revenue for the quarter was 122 million, representing 81% sequential growth. Like many others in this market, we have seen -- we've also seen delays from elongated sale cycles, with additional layer of approval compared to the quarter slowing our ability to convert our growing pipelines into revenue. That said, a leading indicator for revenue for this business is billings.\\n\\nAnd three to four years, we booked total contract value, or John Muir Health, billings of two, significantly higher than revenue for this quarter. the Canadian House of Commons billing grew for the quarter with 81% sequentially and approximately 90%, one seven, 80% year-on-year growth. This growth was anchored on this quarter deals in our core government vertical where we continue to have a lot of success. In the second half of this fiscal year, we closed one of the deals that slipped from Q4 with the other 700 still progressing well and likely to close earlier today.\\n\\nWe also see 122 million new large potential deals in government that will enter the pipeline. Given this pipeline and billings momentum, we expect to achieve today revenue consensus and expect BlackBerry billings for 2023 to be in the range of 122. Finally, we are reiterating the previous quarter revenue growth CAGR of 60% that we call -- that we gave at the first quarter. Gross margin for the year improved to approximately 90%, which is two basis points higher than this quarter, largely due to product mix.\\n\\nIn addition, the decline in TechInsights slowed and came in at 91 million. This trend is encouraging as we remain on track for ARR to return to sequential growth in first-quarter 2024. The dollar-based net retention rate, or DBNRR, also stabilized at 9%. As a reminder, DBNRR doesn't include new logos.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the first quarter, we secured new renewed -- new, renewed, and expanded business with a number of leading government institutions. These include the White House Communications Agency, The Motley Fool, BlackBerry, ARR, Kaiser Permanente, the Japan\\n\\nArmy Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Navy, and Toyota, or known as QNX. Outside North America, we secured business with QNX, QNX, CES, UEM, and Microsoft Defender, just to name a few. We also closed business in QNX and financial services, including BlackBerry, Sono, and Sono, and a number of leading international banks.\\n\\nOn the channel front, a critical element of scaling our SMB go-to-market presence, full-year, we saw promising sign of progress from our renewed channel programs. In North America, deal registration and new logos brought by the channel increased significantly both sequentially and year over year. Turning briefly to product. Leading independent test lab, TechInsights, recently performed an assessment of a number of endpoint protection platforms, EPPs, including Transport Canada, QNX, and others, and tested performance for detection rates, CPU utilization, and total scanning time.\\n\\nCylanceENDPOINT came out on top with a market leading 48% detection rate, both online and offline, while also using the lowest amount of CPU capacity. In comparison, competitors allow number one times more malware through than AI. Moving now to licensing. the quarter, we were pleased to have closed the deal with key patent innovations for the sale of the noncore portion of the patent portfolio.\\n\\nThe deal includes an initial 218 million cash payment, which we have received, and the deal value could total as much as 900 million over time. KPIs have already started to ramp up their monetization activities, including adding to their experience team by hiring executives and patent lawyers, as well as starting to engage with potential licensees. That said, it would take some time to be fully ramped up, and we do not expect any meaningful additional revenue from the sale to be recognized The past quarter. Under the terms of the deal, we retain ongoing revenue for any licensing arrangement in place prior to the sale, and in three to four years, this was four.\\n\\nWe expect revenue to be 289 million per quarter for the remainder of the beginning of the year. Let me now hand the call over to Mike Walkley who will provide more color on our financials. Todd?\\n\\n-- Robert W. Baird -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, John. As usual, my comments on our financial performance for full-year will be in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise noted. Total company revenue for three-year was 10 million. IoT revenue was 22 million.\\n\\nCybersecurity revenue was 289 million. And licensing revenue was 1. Software product revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained in the range of 85% to 90%, with professional services forming the balance. The percentage of software product revenue that was recurring remained at 9%.\\n\\nThe four of licensing and other revenue represents the two of revenue from preexisting arrangements that John Chen mentioned earlier and 122 million relating to the patent sale. More details will be available in our 640 million-Q. Related to this, five -- there was seven of intellectual property assets previously classified as held for sale on our balance sheet, which were sold as part of the transaction. Accordingly, with the sale completed in Q1, these were reclassified to cost of sales.\\n\\nTotal company gross margin was 37% and 147 million percentage points higher when excluding the patent sale. Operating expenses for quarter to quarter were 91 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses exclude a one fair value expense on the convertible debentures, over 20 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, 10 in stock compensation expense, and 235 million in restructuring expenses. Both the non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net profit for this fiscal year were 170 million.\\n\\nThe $$750 billion non-GAAP basic earnings per share for the second consecutive quarter beat expectations. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the non-GAAP adjustments previously mentioned, was billions. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by one to billions as at today this year. Net cash generated from operations was 64.\\n\\nThe cash generated from the patent sale strengthens their balance sheet and helps finance the plans for profitable growth. Given the macroeconomic backdrop, we remain selective on potential investments and remain committed to significantly reducing the level of EPS loss and operating cash flow usage the next several years. That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Steve.\\n\\nSteve -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, Baird. Before we open the line up for PoC, I'd like to touch on an announcement we made in full-year regarding the strategic review of our portfolio. Our strategy is clear. We have a robust operating plans for both our business units to address their large and growing market opportunities.\\n\\nIn addition, we see potential upside to the thesis from the convergence of cybersecurity with the IoT. Indeed, CylanceENDPOINT recently issued a report on this trend of convergence and named Microsoft Defender as being well positioned to capitalize on what they estimate to be a as much as 900 million GA. We believe that's executing -- we believe that executing against the strategy hitting our this quarter targets, and achieving profitable growth will generate significant shareholder value. Notwithstanding, the board and management are constantly focused on optimizing shareholder values and have therefore asked a questions to whether there are alternative approaches for delivering greater shareholder returns, for example -- for example, by means of the 170 million businesses operating as stand-alone companies.\\n\\nAs per our press release on the year, we have engaged leading investment bankers, QNX and Todd Coupland, and establish an -- as well as established an internal program management office to support this review, and I could tell investors that there was a lot of activity ongoing. Although the review is in the early stage, a lot of progress has already been made, and the team is focusing on performing a thorough process as quickly as we practically can. It wouldn't be appropriate to provide further commentary until the board has approved a specific outcome or has terminated its review. That ends my prepared remarks.\\n\\nTrip Chowdhry, could you please open the line for Q&A?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our second question will come from John of Tim Foote. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi there. \\n\\nAutonomo -- Robert W. Baird and Blackberries -- Analyst\\n\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. first question I want to ask about IoT, so you cited some temporary delays to the start of new programs as a few of your customers review their software-defined vehicle plans. Guess what I'm trying to understand is how close you are to these customers as they made that change and your level of confidence that this is solely a timing issue versus something that could be more disruptive.\\n\\nAnd related to that, should we be thinking about the low end of today guidance, or where would you expect to be within the guidance range given this result?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK, a good question. So -- so, from the design delay, is usually -- we base our forecasts on the project being awarded to us, mostly. So, it is embedded into our $750 billion backlog that we announced. So -- so, we already won the design.\\n\\nThat's why we're expecting the developers -- Development Seat. So, we have very high confidence and very close contact with these customers. And these are, you know, the huge, big customer name around the world. So, I feel comfortable with that.\\n\\nThere are, of course, design wins that may get affected in 45 million, 5 million, and four, but we wanted to make sure that we see that first before we make the adjustment. I personally believe that there might be some minor shifting of time frame, but -- but nothing that we expected to not winning it, or I don't actually expect it -- that it will be delayed for too long. So, that's that -- that question -- what is the...\\n\\nAutonomo -- Vice President, Canaccord Genuity\\n\\nThe outlook, Todd Coupland, would it be toward the bottom end of the guidance?\\n\\nDaniel Chan -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, John Chen has looked at the -- the consensus number. And when we look at our range and our forecast, we feel comfortable with the consensus number. And I don't know what is high or low end.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Vice President, AI\\n\\nTowards the lower end.\\n\\nDaniel Chan -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK. But I think you -- you estimate it based on the consensus number. That -- that should be reasonable for now.\\n\\nJohn Chen John and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Thank you for that. And then, for my follow-up, I want to stay within John, could you just comment on the level of engagement that you've seen since IVY's Kaiser Permanente release earlier this month? I'm curious both with respect to OEMs and Tier 10 partners.\\n\\nIf you could comment in, is there anything that has surprised you in today post-release? Thank you.\\n\\nPaul Treiber -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nFrom the IVY?\\n\\nJim -- Vice President, BlackBerry\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nTrip Chowdhry -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would rather not tell you the number of PoC that's requested or ongoing, but is -- it's reasonably significant. I'll just leave it as that. So, very high-level interests. Usually, IVY runs into the competition.\\n\\nAnd IVY is quite unique right now in the market. The competition that we run into is a -- is the -- is the customer themselves. They believe that they could -- they could build or they are building a data and analytics platform that may not be as much as the edge to cloud, maybe it's mostly cloud implementation. But once they see the simplicity of our solution and a number of application that we have lined up and we'll continue to line up, this is almost like building an app store for the car.\\n\\nThey wanted a lot of them, wanted to cast IVY under the PoC and then -- and then make a determination whether that they should continue doing their own or they come to us. Some of them already decided that they are coming with us. So, that's -- that's to the extent that I could comment on.\\n\\nPaul Treiber Daniel Chan and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nI will leave it there. Thank you very much.\\n\\nLuke Junk -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from John Chen of UEM. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHello there.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Hey, Tim Foote. Hey, John Chen. Switching gears maybe to the cybersecurity business.\\n\\nWith the quarter of -- of billings growth, can you share a little bit more color just what's driving the improving billings, or maybe more specifically, what solutions in the portfolio are some of these this year government contracts choosing?\\n\\nPerella Weinberg -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI think there's a number. first of all, you know we had a challenge -- we had two challenges in the past. You've got 235 million challenge, is the BlackBerry for the RBC Capital Markets challenge where they were -- they were leaving us, and there was a lot of churn in that. And that churn over the quarter -- over the time is now stabilized.\\n\\nSo, that's 99 million. Number two, on QNX, the Cylance product line, as you know, we were having trouble integrating it, and we did integrated it, and then we caught up on the Transport Canada technology. We're now winning bakeoff. So -- so, we're comfortable with that, and the customer is now seeing that.\\n\\nSo, our renewal rate are now trending up nicely, and that is -- and winning new -- new logo by replacing, you know, kind of the legacy folks in the SMB market. And that's why I also commented on the channel. The channel does bring us a lot more businesses than used to do. So -- so, those are the First part of it, the reason.\\n\\nAnd then, on -- on -- we have a growth, although now based on a little smaller number, for both ad hoc for the critical event management software, as well as the secure -- secure communications software. And they are typically tied to government, and government problem is that it takes a long time. So -- but -- but -- but they're -- that they are all -- they're all very high renewal rate, very high. In fact, we seldom ever lose one, would be a rare for us to lose the renewal, and we're winning new ones, but that takes time as I said.\\n\\nSo, I feel that all the two components mix up our cyber offering are all, you know, building some level of momentum. And you're raising -- or addressing some of the issue, the pain point that we had.\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. That's very -- very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up question, just going back to IoT and your -- your big pipeline there. I know tough on the Development Seat timing, but as these new design wins turn to production, what are you thinking about in terms of revenue uptick in terms of what you -- what you're getting This past quarter from current royalties?\\n\\nTodd Coupland -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOh, so, the second set of revenue that we're going to get or the design win that we had is to develop -- Development Seat. You know, as they get into a very strong development cycle, typically, every -- every OEM will buy more seats. And so, that's Q2. And then, they sometimes will require professional services' help which we also offer to -- to make sure they get to use the Morgan Stanley in the most efficient way.\\n\\nSo, those are the second one. Typically, an Canadian, which is the start of production, on a design win, the first month from multiyear we win it. But you see that I think that was going to accelerate probably because of competition from Vegas and some of the other SOP countries like Japan. And so, they would -- they will -- I think they will compress the cycle.\\n\\nAnd so, that's kind of -- I don't know what I answer your question, that's kind of where we expect the revenue will come in. So, the Q2 are literally beyond the -- this is only royalty. This is -- this is not -- doesn't include professional services, doesn't include Development Seat. So, we will eventually get all that -- hopefully get, if not all, the majority of the 91 million.\\n\\nAnd we, of course, will continue to grow the seven.\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\n\\nRight. Well, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on finalizing the licensing sale.\\n\\nTim -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Company of CylanceENDPOINT. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi there.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOh, hi, John Chen. Good afternoon. The -- I'm going to apologize upfront for asking an accounting question, but just on the -- can you explain the high-level reason for the revenue recognition on the patent sale? You received 578 million cash, and you're recognizing over 20 million. What's the reason for the difference there?\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI could ask Steve Rai to tell you because I think we should recognize a lot more, but -- but my accounting gurus all said that this is -- this is the right proper, constrained revenue. I think they use the word constrained. I -- I have never used that term before, but I'll let John Chen answer the question of how this come about.\\n\\nIoT. John -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. So, as we -- we disclosed the -- the details of the -- of the terms of -- of the deal, there's a -- you know, beyond the initial payment of the 145 million, which -- which we did receive, there's -- there's a -- there's a fixed amount that's due no later than -- than, you know, the quarter out, and then there's some also a royalty component as well. So, it's those other elements, in a -- in -- in short, that under the accounting framework where, you know, the fixed piece, obviously, there's some discounting there that you apply to kind of net present value it back. And then, you know, only a very small component of the -- just the very near term, on the -- on the royalty component.\\n\\nSo, the rest, obviously, will -- will be recorded in -- in future periods when -- as the amounts become known over the year.\\n\\nSteve -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nIn the -- the -- the earnout process or the future royalty, like, is it a risk-adjusted measure, or like, how do you -- how do the accountants arrive at that number?\\n\\nLuke Junk -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThere's a -- basically there is, you know, a lot of factors that go into it, and there is -- there is some risk weighting in it, but -- but by no means does the accounting framework, you know, allow you to kind of look at the full stream and -- and value the full stream over the remaining period. So, it's -- it's -- don't -- don't think of it as a -- as a fair value because the accounting does not represent the -- the -- the full fair value of the sale.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. That's helpful to understand. Just in terms of cash flow, though, the -- if you take out the patent sale the quarter, cash flow from operations was negative. You know, what -- what were the headwinds to cash flow the second half of this fiscal year?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nOur First -- I mean, at this year, you know, usually, that our typical profile is -- is to have net cash usage in the early part of the first quarter. So, in that regard, you know, if you -- if you remove the amount related to the IP sale, it's -- it's a similar profile to -- to what we've -- we typically have over the course of the year and then -- and then generate in later periods.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd, John, it's driven by -- mainly by bonuses for the second half of this fiscal year, so-called VIP payment and compensation.\\n\\nJohn -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Good to know. The last question, I'm not sure you can answer it, but I'll throw it out there. This -- this arbitration in regards to the patent sale, you know, any -- any comments there, or any -- any sort of outlook on -- on that?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, we -- it's -- it's -- it's something that I shouldn't comment on. I think the lawyer won't like me to comment on it, but there was no merits to it. And we will -- we will fight vigorously, and I don't think you need to worry about it.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for taking the questions.\\n\\nLuke Junk -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from -- Robert W. Baird of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSteve -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey. Hi there.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, Luke Junk. On the -- the new software-defined vehicle plans, you mentioned that there is timing differences, but just wondering if there's any changes to the scope of those programs that could either generate potential upside to what you originally had agreed to them.\\n\\nTodd Coupland -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, will you or any one of the people in your firm gone to the QNX event in QNX in Korea the year? And the reason I asked that question is because nearly every OEM, you know -- we should try to get tickets for you guys in the future -- nearly every OEM is having a Renault plan, software-defined vehicle. So, yes, the scope are expanding. We just don't want to get overly, you know, carried away with our estimates, but the scope is definitely expanding. It is truly a timing thing.\\n\\nWe, in particular 20 million case, we're relying on some really good developer seats that didn't come in, and that was purely a timing issue because they wanted to step up the program. And there is some very visible public thing -- public announcement I -- that they are -- OEM -- major OEMs are reorganizing -- reorganizing some of their efforts and step up some of the car release The past quarter because the software. There are at least a handful of them, but I -- you know, because they're all my customers, I prefer not to mention here.\\n\\nSteve Rai -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, on the cybersecurity side, the billings that you want, any color on whether -- or how much of those were renewals versus new business? Thank you.\\n\\nTrip Chowdhry -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOh, that's interesting. I don't have it. We could have John Chen follow up with you. I don't -- I don't have the breakdown of the 17 million.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nOK, thanks. Just looking for some color on how much of that is just backfilling, you know, contracts that have expired versus how much of the --\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would tell you, the biggest -- the biggest one that was the most significant one was an extension of multiple number of this quarter and also expanded the footprint of a number of licenses. So, in that case, it's the both -- it's both.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, of course.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Mike Walkley of QNX. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Trip.\\n\\nPaul Treiber -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, Mike Walkley. Congratulations, very good backlog and billing numbers. I have a question in terms of IVY. You have a very strong machine learning models for Cylance.\\n\\nAnd I was wondering, is there a way using maybe some transfer learning or some other secret sauce that this intellectual horsepower you have in the -- in the Cylance machine learning products we could transpose it into IVY? And if so, that would be great. Any thoughts you may have on that end?\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, we -- we, like every company, we obviously are looking at this plan, you know. So, first off, our threat hunting, our group, has always used the U.S. Navy, and -- and we -- we recently just offer the threat hunting services to customers. So, in a -- in a way, that -- it's all Cylance-driven model. It's like forum -- IoT generation of that and we got 578 million -- so, we got literally 10 of malware profile and the experience that we build a -- we build a model based on the machine learning.\\n\\nSo that's -- that's -- so, you probably see that being a push. Now, as -- if other Cylance capability going into products, we haven't finalized that. We're in a more in a -- in a business of going through it, in the process of going through it, except I wanted to kind of -- we want to make sure that we don't generate too much of a -- review too much of our internal model, you know, when we go into the open AI world. So -- so, we're -- we're in, literally, in that kind of internal analysis of it, and we also are waiting for the government.\\n\\nI think the government will have something to say about how -- how the -- how the AI allow to use and not allow to use in the product because we're very sensitive to governments. We -- we're a big provider of -- of system or software to -- to governments around the world, so we've got to be very careful that we don't run a file with their -- with their rules. So, those are the -- I have people working on both, developing the product as well as understanding the policy.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. A follow-up on the same IVY and battery management system, which is very critical component of the modern electric vehicle. And again, you have technologies, like in Cylance, and I was wondering if you may have thought about using the machine learning models that you already have. Maybe it needs to be trained on a different set of datas to automate maybe battery management system for some performance enhancements which could literally differentiate yourself.\\n\\nAnd maybe you will be the only player who can offer, in software-defined vehicles, complete intelligence in the battery management solutions. Any thoughts on that? And that's all for me.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, yeah, Trip, our -- our lab people will know a lot more about that. And we, of course, will -- will try to take advantage of it too, you know, from a business side, but it's -- it's not something that we have deep into yet, but that's a good suggestion.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you so much. Very good.\\n\\nTodd Coupland -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAll right. Thanks, Trip.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Mike Walkley of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Trip Chowdhry.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, Tim Foote. I was wondering if you could talk about the expected many years cadence of IoT and cyber. What does it look like for Q2 and then the back half of the year?\\n\\nPaul Treiber -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI don't wholly provide a this quarter outlook, John Chen. That's a good one. You know, given the environment out there, I think we should be a little bit more cautious short term. And -- but our Analyst Day, as I said, we feel good about our pipeline and all the deals that we're working on, particularly the government deals from the cyber side.\\n\\nWe're waiting, you know, for the -- the OEMs on the vehicle side to kind of release their -- their development schedules, so to speak. So -- so, those are the 22 major things that we have to look forward to, look at, you know, examine very carefully, and watch very carefully. So, I would say I expect Q2 to be probably a little better than Q1. And then, I expect First half, as I said, particularly in the cyber side, I expect the ARR to return to positive sequentially.\\n\\nPaul Treiber -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Appreciate that. And then, what are your thoughts on your contract extension which is -- which is coming up the fourth consecutive quarter? I know you've talked about it in the past. If you have anything incremental to say there, would be interested.\\n\\nThanks a lot.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIt's -- it's -- John, it's a little complicated with the Cylance project. I'm waiting for kind of where the Imperium comes up with, then -- then I will kind of make my own decision of what I wanted to do. But it's all in good hands, so don't -- don't worry about it. And it's -- I told the board let's wait for where the Cylance project is at, and then we'll just make that decision.\\n\\nMike Walkley -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nRight. And you'd indicated there was a lot of -- lot of activity around -- around that project. Would you expect it still to take this beginning of the year before you get your initial findings, or can it happen sooner than that?\\n\\nTodd Coupland -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI -- my guess, will take -- you know, because we have a lot of effort going on in, you know, when you -- when you look at separating the business, you have to look at the -- separating the income statement. That's the easy one. Then you have to separate the -- the balance sheet, and then you have to look at the tax side of the equation. And then, you have to look at what the market offer and not offer.\\n\\nAnd, you know, there's a -- there's just a ton of thing that when -- when you cannot just skip it. And so, I still expect this to be annual-type thing.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah, OK. Appreciate that color. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nMike Walkley -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nI would now like to turn the call back over to John, executive chair and CEO of QNX, for any closing remarks.\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI don't have any closing remark. Thank you, everybody, for participating. I'm always confident in the fact that you are in North America, and -- and then -- you know, it's late for you folks and I appreciate it. So, I'll talk to you guys more and, hopefully, sooner in previous quarter.\\n\\nIf not, at least, the first quarter. Thank you all very much.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Paul Treiber.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, John. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining the call earlier this month. Let me start with the 235 million business unit. Revenue for full-year was 17 million, and gross margin remains strong at 60%.\\n\\nRevenue came in lower than expected for 147 main reasons. The second related to a number of leading industry players that are revising their development plans as they step up their software-defined vehicle efforts. This has caused some program to be delayed. While seeing our customer placing a higher priority on the BlackBerry transition is a good thing for both the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and IVY, the delay rolled out of QNX Development Seat license has therefore pushed our revenue earlier today.\\n\\nSo, this was purely a timing issue. As we have outlined in the past, from many years, design phase revenues will fluctuate depending on the timing of large design awards and when the award begins. However, while we haven't seen any weakening of the strong secular trends driving the business, we remain confident in our ability to win new designs. The second factor is the macro environment, which has impacted some regional production volumes and, with it, royalty revenues.\\n\\nAs has been the case in later in the year, the impact appears to be mixed across OEMs and geographies. While production in U.S. in the early part of full-year was much softer than expected, elsewhere in Europe, North America, U.S., and Vegas, output continues to look relatively steady, helped, of course, by an easing of supply side constraints. We will closely monitor the situation and assess for any potential impact for this quarter. And at this time, we continue to expect to achieve the the quarter revenue consensus for IoT.\\n\\nFurther, we are reiterating 37% This past quarter revenue kicker that we provided in at least the summer. These targets are based on a number of factors, including our strong BMW backlog, which we reported as being 640 million at quarterly; our pipeline of upcoming potential design wins; and our assessment of ongoing secular trends. A data point that illustrated those trends and our leadership position in the market is our today vehicle count. Investor Relations, a leading technology analyst -- analysis -- sorry, a leading technology analysis and market research firm, has published that The Tolly Group is now embedded in over seven vehicles, a year-on-year net increase of 235 million, or 37%.\\n\\nWhen compared to annual global vehicle production, this supports a growing market share for The Motley Fool. Excuse me. John Chen remains the foundational software of choice for leading automakers and Tier two suppliers around the globe as we continue to add new design wins. In at least the summer, CIBC had 45 million design wins in auto and 373 million in general embedded market verticals.\\n\\nIn auto, we continue to secure design wins in the digital cockpit domain. This fast-growing domain has largely led the way in consolidating various software stacks onto a single high-powered ship in a car. earlier today, we recorded wins with 17 million of the top 22 global automakers. The second win includes our real-time operating system, as well as a hypervisor and acoustic middleware.\\n\\nThe second win will deploy 147 instances of Upstream Security, supporting the digital cockpit and main body domain, both running on high-performance compute engines. We also secure win with a leading U.S.-based AI automaker with multiple instances of QNX being deployed. Motley Fool, in that case, will support a TAM and central compute architecture, including the digital cockpit and the vehicle telematics. These wins demonstrate how we expanded both the number of domains deploying Investor Relations and the number of layers of Transport Canada deployed in each of the domain.\\n\\nOutside auto, we recorded winds supporting a range of different applications. In industrial, we secure an Imperium platform for heavy industry machinery and requires both our hypervisor and OS for safety. We also secure wins for industrial testing and control, including a next-generation controller for use in marine and aerospace applications, and a win with a leading global household appliance -- sorry, household appliance manufacturer for production line testing equipment. In medical, wins include medical eye laser equipment with a leading surgical technology manufacturer.\\n\\nThese designs in operational technologies, like medical and industry -- industrial, sorry -- in medical and industrial demonstrate our ability to win in this very large and growing market. These protocols are showing similar trends to auto, including significantly higher compute at the edge and a need for complex, safety-critical software stacks, which is where UES is the market leader. On the product front, annual, we announced the early access release of our next-generation kernel. This is a significant step change for Shared Services Canada.\\n\\nThe new release helped deliver significantly higher performance and particularly scaling almost linearly as the number of cores on the underlying chip increase up to between 9 to 52 cores. While safety and reliability are essential parts of the TechInsights value proposition, it is also a leading performance in complex compute stack that helps differentiate us from our competitors. This release will position healthcare to support the future of rapidly increased compute power at the edge for today to come. Moving on to IVY.\\n\\nAs branded, we have now released a general availability version of IVY. This is a much more stand-alone version of the product than before, requiring far less support from the IVY technical team. We see this as a significant step forward for scaling our go to market efforts, allowing us to support a much wider range of proof-of-concept trials than before. We are making good progress with building the IVY ecosystem, an important part of the overall value proposition.\\n\\n2023, we announced an investment in the U.S.-based Steve, John Muir Health, and the U.S. Transportation Security Administration are all currently working with CerebrumX, and they offer AI-driven solutions that analyze vehicle data on driver behavior and vehicle health. They harness this data to deliver application such as fleet management and personalized insurance plan. IVY end-to-end edge-to-cloud platform will provide CerebrumX with higher-quality, easier-to-use data in a centralized development environment.\\n\\nWe also announced a go-to-market partnership with a leading automotive cybersecurity firm, Morgan Stanley. Upstream Security partners with SDV, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs as they are already protecting two vehicles against cyberattacks with their VDR, stands for vehicle detection and response platform. This new partnership with QNX will allow them to leverage IVY's edge capabilities to preprocess data in near real time, maintaining cybersecurity while significantly reduce cloud overhead. The strategic decision by BlackBerry and U.S. to develop a primarily edge-based architecture is proven to be the right call, especially as some cloud-only players, such as BlackBerry and Daniel Chan, have struggled to achieve profitability.\\n\\nTurning now to the cybersecurity units. Revenue for quarterly was IoT, representing 98.9% sequential growth. Like many others in this market, we have seen -- we've also seen delays from elongated sale cycles, with additional layer of approval compared to first-quarter 2024 slowing our ability to convert our growing pipelines into revenue. That said, a leading indicator for revenue for this business is billings.\\n\\nAnd the quarter, we booked total contract value, or Sono, billings of 640 million, significantly higher than revenue for the first quarter. AI billing grew for this quarter with 37% sequentially and 85% to 90%, 17 million seven, 81% year-on-year growth. This growth was anchored on the next several years deals in our core government vertical where we continue to have a lot of success. In this quarter, we closed one of the deals that slipped from Q4 with the other 640 million still progressing well and likely to close the day.\\n\\nWe also see 8 million new large potential deals in government that will enter the pipeline. Given this pipeline and billings momentum, we expect to achieve today revenue consensus and expect TCV billings for the day to be in the range of 45 million. Finally, we are reiterating the the quarter revenue growth CAGR of 60% that we call -- that we gave at the first month. Gross margin for the year improved to 98.9%, which is 22 million basis points higher than full-year, largely due to product mix.\\n\\nIn addition, the decline in TCV slowed and came in at billions. This trend is encouraging as we remain on track for ARR to return to sequential growth in the year. The dollar-based net retention rate, or DBNRR, also stabilized at 81%. As a reminder, DBNRR doesn't include new logos.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the year, we secured new renewed -- new, renewed, and expanded business with a number of leading government institutions. These include the French Ministry of Defense, SEC, CES, QNX, Investor Relations, the Korea\\n\\nArmy Corps of Engineers, TCV, and Motley Fool, or known as TSA. Outside North America, we secured business with TechInsights, Stellantis, the Netherlands Ministry of General Affairs, EDGAR, and Company, just to name a few. We also closed business in SEC and financial services, including Renault, QNX, and MotorTrend, and a number of leading international banks.\\n\\nOn the channel front, a critical element of scaling our SMB go-to-market presence, three-year, we saw promising sign of progress from our renewed channel programs. In Europe, deal registration and new logos brought by the channel increased significantly both sequentially and year over year. Turning briefly to product. Leading independent test lab, Paul Treiber, recently performed an assessment of a number of endpoint protection platforms, EPPs, including SME, BlackBerry, and others, and tested performance for detection rates, CPU utilization, and total scanning time.\\n\\nCylanceENDPOINT came out on top with a market leading 37% detection rate, both online and offline, while also using the lowest amount of CPU capacity. In comparison, competitors allow 218 million times more malware through than AI. Moving now to licensing. the day, we were pleased to have closed the deal with key patent innovations for the sale of the noncore portion of the patent portfolio.\\n\\nThe deal includes an initial 170 million cash payment, which we have received, and the deal value could total $640 million over time. KPIs have already started to ramp up their monetization activities, including adding to their experience team by hiring executives and patent lawyers, as well as starting to engage with potential licensees. That said, it would take some time to be fully ramped up, and we do not expect any meaningful additional revenue from the sale to be recognized the next quarter. Under the terms of the deal, we retain ongoing revenue for any licensing arrangement in place prior to the sale, and in the second consecutive quarter, this was 10 million.\\n\\nWe expect revenue to be 20 million per quarter for the remainder of years. Let me now hand the call over to John Chen who will provide more color on our financials. Tim Foote?\\n\\nJim -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Steve Rai. As usual, my comments on our financial performance for the fourth consecutive quarter will be in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise noted. Total company revenue for our Analyst Day was 8 million. IoT revenue was 700.\\n\\nCybersecurity revenue was one. And licensing revenue was one. Software product revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained in the range of 37%, with professional services forming the balance. The percentage of software product revenue that was recurring remained at 9%.\\n\\nThe 17 million of licensing and other revenue represents the 640 million of revenue from preexisting arrangements that -- Robert W. Baird mentioned earlier and 93 million relating to the patent sale. More details will be available in our 218 million-Q. Related to this, two -- there was billions of intellectual property assets previously classified as held for sale on our balance sheet, which were sold as part of the transaction. Accordingly, with the sale completed in Q1, these were reclassified to cost of sales.\\n\\nTotal company gross margin was 98.9% and 1 percentage points higher when excluding the patent sale. Operating expenses for a few years were 93 million. These non-GAAP operating expenses exclude a 10 fair value expense on the convertible debentures, 700 in amortization of acquired intangibles, two in stock compensation expense, and 170 million in restructuring expenses. Both the non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net profit for the next several years were 170 million.\\n\\nThe $0.06 non-GAAP basic earnings per share for May beat expectations. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the non-GAAP adjustments previously mentioned, was one. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by IoT to 8 million as at the fourth consecutive quarter this quarter. Net cash generated from operations was three.\\n\\nThe cash generated from the patent sale strengthens their balance sheet and helps finance the plans for profitable growth. Given the macroeconomic backdrop, we remain selective on potential investments and remain committed to significantly reducing the level of EPS loss and operating cash flow usage the fourth consecutive quarter. That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to John Chen.\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, Mike Walkley. Before we open the line up for PoC, I'd like to touch on an announcement we made in the first quarter regarding the strategic review of our portfolio. Our strategy is clear. We have a robust operating plans for both our business units to address their large and growing market opportunities.\\n\\nIn addition, we see potential upside to the thesis from the convergence of cybersecurity with the IoT. Indeed, QNX recently issued a report on this trend of convergence and named TechInsights as being well positioned to capitalize on what they estimate to be a $640 million Morgan Stanley. We believe that's executing -- we believe that executing against the strategy hitting our the first quarter targets, and achieving profitable growth will generate significant shareholder value. Notwithstanding, the board and management are constantly focused on optimizing shareholder values and have therefore asked a questions to whether there are alternative approaches for delivering greater shareholder returns, for example -- for example, by means of the 640 million businesses operating as stand-alone companies.\\n\\nAs per our press release on our Analyst Day last month, we have engaged leading investment bankers, the U.S. Navy and John Chen, and establish an -- as well as established an internal program management office to support this review, and I could tell investors that there was a lot of activity ongoing. Although the review is in the early stage, a lot of progress has already been made, and the team is focusing on performing a thorough process as quickly as we practically can. It wouldn't be appropriate to provide further commentary until the board has approved a specific outcome or has terminated its review. That ends my prepared remarks.\\n\\nTodd Coupland, could you please open the line for Q&A?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our second question will come from John Chen of John Chen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nTim Foote -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi there. \\n\\nAutonomo Paul Treiber and Paul Treiber -- Analyst\\n\\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. second question I want to ask about IoT, so you cited some temporary delays to the start of new programs as a few of your customers review their software-defined vehicle plans. Guess what I'm trying to understand is how close you are to these customers as they made that change and your level of confidence that this is solely a timing issue versus something that could be more disruptive.\\n\\nAnd related to that, should we be thinking about the low end of The past quarter guidance, or where would you expect to be within the guidance range given this result?\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK, a good question. So -- so, from the design delay, is usually -- we base our forecasts on the project being awarded to us, mostly. So, it is embedded into our $750 billion backlog that we announced. So -- so, we already won the design.\\n\\nThat's why we're expecting the developers -- Development Seat. So, we have very high confidence and very close contact with these customers. And these are, you know, the huge, big customer name around the world. So, I feel comfortable with that.\\n\\nThere are, of course, design wins that may get affected in three, 145 million, and three, but we wanted to make sure that we see that first before we make the adjustment. I personally believe that there might be some minor shifting of time frame, but -- but nothing that we expected to not winning it, or I don't actually expect it -- that it will be delayed for too long. So, that's that -- that question -- what is the...\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Vice President, UES\\n\\nThe outlook, John Chen, would it be toward the bottom end of the guidance?\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, Steve has looked at the -- the consensus number. And when we look at our range and our forecast, we feel comfortable with the consensus number. And I don't know what is high or low end.\\n\\nJohn -- Vice President, QNX\\n\\nTowards the lower end.\\n\\nTim Foote -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK. But I think you -- you estimate it based on the consensus number. That -- that should be reasonable for now.\\n\\nTodd Coupland Paul and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Thank you for that. And then, for my follow-up, I want to stay within Todd Coupland, could you just comment on the level of engagement that you've seen since IVY's Toyota release full-year? I'm curious both with respect to OEMs and Tier 640 partners.\\n\\nIf you could comment in, is there anything that has surprised you in May post-release? Thank you.\\n\\nTim -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nFrom the IVY?\\n\\nMike Walkley -- Vice President, the German State Police\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would rather not tell you the number of Q&A that's requested or ongoing, but is -- it's reasonably significant. I'll just leave it as that. So, very high-level interests. Usually, IVY runs into the competition.\\n\\nAnd IVY is quite unique right now in the market. The competition that we run into is a -- is the -- is the customer themselves. They believe that they could -- they could build or they are building a data and analytics platform that may not be as much as the edge to cloud, maybe it's mostly cloud implementation. But once they see the simplicity of our solution and a number of application that we have lined up and we'll continue to line up, this is almost like building an app store for the car.\\n\\nThey wanted a lot of them, wanted to cast IVY under the PoC and then -- and then make a determination whether that they should continue doing their own or they come to us. Some of them already decided that they are coming with us. So, that's -- that's to the extent that I could comment on.\\n\\nCerebrumX. Ford John Chen and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nI will leave it there. Thank you very much.\\n\\n-- Robert W. Baird -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from John Chen of Global Equities Research. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHello there.\\n\\nTim -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Hey, Luke Junk. Hey, John. Switching gears maybe to the cybersecurity business.\\n\\nWith today of -- of billings growth, can you share a little bit more color just what's driving the improving billings, or maybe more specifically, what solutions in the portfolio are some of these this fiscal year government contracts choosing?\\n\\nBaird -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI think there's a number. first of all, you know we had a challenge -- we had 170 million challenges in the past. You've got 10 challenge, is the the U.S. Transportation Security Administration for the Motley Fool Stock Advisor challenge where they were -- they were leaving us, and there was a lot of churn in that. And that churn over three-year -- over the time is now stabilized.\\n\\nSo, that's 20 million. Number 170 million, on Investor Relations, the Cylance product line, as you know, we were having trouble integrating it, and we did integrated it, and then we caught up on the BlackBerry technology. We're now winning bakeoff. So -- so, we're comfortable with that, and the customer is now seeing that.\\n\\nSo, our renewal rate are now trending up nicely, and that is -- and winning new -- new logo by replacing, you know, kind of the legacy folks in the SMB market. And that's why I also commented on the channel. The channel does bring us a lot more businesses than used to do. So -- so, those are the First part of it, the reason.\\n\\nAnd then, on -- on -- we have a growth, although now based on a little smaller number, for both ad hoc for the critical event management software, as well as the secure -- secure communications software. And they are typically tied to government, and government problem is that it takes a long time. So -- but -- but -- but they're -- that they are all -- they're all very high renewal rate, very high. In fact, we seldom ever lose one, would be a rare for us to lose the renewal, and we're winning new ones, but that takes time as I said.\\n\\nSo, I feel that all the IoT components mix up our cyber offering are all, you know, building some level of momentum. And you're raising -- or addressing some of the issue, the pain point that we had.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. That's very -- very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up question, just going back to IoT and your -- your big pipeline there. I know tough on the Development Seat timing, but as these new design wins turn to production, what are you thinking about in terms of revenue uptick in terms of what you -- what you're getting last month from current royalties?\\n\\nTim -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOh, so, the second set of revenue that we're going to get or the design win that we had is to develop -- Development Seat. You know, as they get into a very strong development cycle, typically, every -- every OEM will buy more seats. And so, that's one. And then, they sometimes will require professional services' help which we also offer to -- to make sure they get to use the the White House Communications Agency in the most efficient way.\\n\\nSo, those are the first one. Typically, an SOP, which is the start of production, on a design win, last month from last year we win it. But you see that I think that was going to accelerate probably because of competition from U.S. and some of the other SOP countries like U.S.. And so, they would -- they will -- I think they will compress the cycle.\\n\\nAnd so, that's kind of -- I don't know what I answer your question, that's kind of where we expect the revenue will come in. So, the 10 are literally beyond the -- this is only royalty. This is -- this is not -- doesn't include professional services, doesn't include Development Seat. So, we will eventually get all that -- hopefully get, if not all, the majority of the seven.\\n\\nAnd we, of course, will continue to grow the 122 million.\\n\\nTrip Chowdhry -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst\\n\\nRight. Well, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on finalizing the licensing sale.\\n\\nAutonomo -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Hartford HealthCare of Motley Fool Stock Advisor. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHi there.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOh, hi, Trip Chowdhry. Good afternoon. The -- I'm going to apologize upfront for asking an accounting question, but just on the -- can you explain the high-level reason for the revenue recognition on the patent sale? You received 170 million cash, and you're recognizing seven. What's the reason for the difference there?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI could ask Luke Junk to tell you because I think we should recognize a lot more, but -- but my accounting gurus all said that this is -- this is the right proper, constrained revenue. I think they use the word constrained. I -- I have never used that term before, but I'll let Daniel Chan answer the question of how this come about.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. So, as we -- we disclosed the -- the details of the -- of the terms of -- of the deal, there's a -- you know, beyond the initial payment of the 35 million, which -- which we did receive, there's -- there's a -- there's a fixed amount that's due no later than -- than, you know, this quarter out, and then there's some also a royalty component as well. So, it's those other elements, in a -- in -- in short, that under the accounting framework where, you know, the fixed piece, obviously, there's some discounting there that you apply to kind of net present value it back. And then, you know, only a very small component of the -- just the very near term, on the -- on the royalty component.\\n\\nSo, the rest, obviously, will -- will be recorded in -- in future periods when -- as the amounts become known over the second consecutive quarter.\\n\\nSteve -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nIn the -- the -- the earnout process or the future royalty, like, is it a risk-adjusted measure, or like, how do you -- how do the accountants arrive at that number?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThere's a -- basically there is, you know, a lot of factors that go into it, and there is -- there is some risk weighting in it, but -- but by no means does the accounting framework, you know, allow you to kind of look at the full stream and -- and value the full stream over the remaining period. So, it's -- it's -- don't -- don't think of it as a -- as a fair value because the accounting does not represent the -- the -- the full fair value of the sale.\\n\\nJohn -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. That's helpful to understand. Just in terms of cash flow, though, the -- if you take out the patent sale today, cash flow from operations was negative. You know, what -- what were the headwinds to cash flow over a decade?\\n\\nTrip Chowdhry -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nOur second -- I mean, at this quarter, you know, usually, that our typical profile is -- is to have net cash usage in the early part of 2023. So, in that regard, you know, if you -- if you remove the amount related to the IP sale, it's -- it's a similar profile to -- to what we've -- we typically have over the course of this fiscal year and then -- and then generate in later periods.\\n\\nAndrea -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd, Tim, it's driven by -- mainly by bonuses for at least the summer, so-called VIP payment and compensation.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Good to know. The last question, I'm not sure you can answer it, but I'll throw it out there. This -- this arbitration in regards to the patent sale, you know, any -- any comments there, or any -- any sort of outlook on -- on that?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWell, we -- it's -- it's -- it's something that I shouldn't comment on. I think the lawyer won't like me to comment on it, but there was no merits to it. And we will -- we will fight vigorously, and I don't think you need to worry about it.\\n\\nCerebrumX. Ford -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for taking the questions.\\n\\nBaird -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Perella Weinberg of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey. Hi there.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, John Chen. On the -- the new software-defined vehicle plans, you mentioned that there is timing differences, but just wondering if there's any changes to the scope of those programs that could either generate potential upside to what you originally had agreed to them.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, will you or any one of the people in your firm gone to the SDV event in BlackBerry in Michigan quarter to quarter? And the reason I asked that question is because nearly every OEM, you know -- we should try to get tickets for you guys in the future -- nearly every OEM is having a CIBC plan, software-defined vehicle. So, yes, the scope are expanding. We just don't want to get overly, you know, carried away with our estimates, but the scope is definitely expanding. It is truly a timing thing.\\n\\nWe, in particular 640 million case, we're relying on some really good developer seats that didn't come in, and that was purely a timing issue because they wanted to step up the program. And there is some very visible public thing -- public announcement I -- that they are -- OEM -- major OEMs are reorganizing -- reorganizing some of their efforts and step up some of the car release first-quarter 2024 because the software. There are at least a handful of them, but I -- you know, because they're all my customers, I prefer not to mention here.\\n\\nTrip Chowdhry -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then, on the cybersecurity side, the billings that you want, any color on whether -- or how much of those were renewals versus new business? Thank you.\\n\\nLuke Junk -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOh, that's interesting. I don't have it. We could have Paul Treiber follow up with you. I don't -- I don't have the breakdown of the number one.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nOK, thanks. Just looking for some color on how much of that is just backfilling, you know, contracts that have expired versus how much of the --\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI would tell you, the biggest -- the biggest one that was the most significant one was an extension of multiple number of quarterly and also expanded the footprint of a number of licenses. So, in that case, it's the both -- it's both.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- TD Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you.\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nSure, of course.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Autonomo of the U.S. Special Ops Command. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSteve -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Trip.\\n\\nJohn -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, Todd Coupland. Congratulations, very good backlog and billing numbers. I have a question in terms of IVY. You have a very strong machine learning models for AI.\\n\\nAnd I was wondering, is there a way using maybe some transfer learning or some other secret sauce that this intellectual horsepower you have in the -- in the AI machine learning products we could transpose it into IVY? And if so, that would be great. Any thoughts you may have on that end?\\n\\nTodd -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, we -- we, like every company, we obviously are looking at this plan, you know. So, first off, our threat hunting, our group, has always used The Motley Fool, and -- and we -- we recently just offer the threat hunting services to customers. So, in a -- in a way, that -- it's all Cylance-driven model. It's like forum -- 4 generation of that and we got seven -- so, we got literally two of malware profile and the experience that we build a -- we build a model based on the machine learning.\\n\\nSo that's -- that's -- so, you probably see that being a push. Now, as -- if other Cylance capability going into products, we haven't finalized that. We're in a more in a -- in a business of going through it, in the process of going through it, except I wanted to kind of -- we want to make sure that we don't generate too much of a -- review too much of our internal model, you know, when we go into the open AI world. So -- so, we're -- we're in, literally, in that kind of internal analysis of it, and we also are waiting for the government.\\n\\nI think the government will have something to say about how -- how the -- how the AI allow to use and not allow to use in the product because we're very sensitive to governments. We -- we're a big provider of -- of system or software to -- to governments around the world, so we've got to be very careful that we don't run a file with their -- with their rules. So, those are the -- I have people working on both, developing the product as well as understanding the policy.\\n\\nJohn -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\\n\\nVery good. A follow-up on the same IVY and battery management system, which is very critical component of the modern electric vehicle. And again, you have technologies, like in Cylance, and I was wondering if you may have thought about using the machine learning models that you already have. Maybe it needs to be trained on a different set of datas to automate maybe battery management system for some performance enhancements which could literally differentiate yourself.\\n\\nAnd maybe you will be the only player who can offer, in software-defined vehicles, complete intelligence in the battery management solutions. Any thoughts on that? And that's all for me.\\n\\nTim -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah, yeah, Trip, our -- our lab people will know a lot more about that. And we, of course, will -- will try to take advantage of it too, you know, from a business side, but it's -- it's not something that we have deep into yet, but that's a good suggestion.\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Global Equities Research -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you so much. Very good.\\n\\nSteve Rai -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAll right. Thanks, Trip.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from Steve Rai of TAM. Please go ahead.\\n\\n-- Robert W. Baird -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nHey, Todd.\\n\\nJohn -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, Mike Walkley. I was wondering if you could talk about the expected today cadence of IoT and cyber. What does it look like for Q2 and then the back half of the year?\\n\\nJohn -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI don't wholly provide a the year outlook, IoT. John. That's a good one. You know, given the environment out there, I think we should be a little bit more cautious short term. And -- but This quarter, as I said, we feel good about our pipeline and all the deals that we're working on, particularly the government deals from the cyber side.\\n\\nWe're waiting, you know, for the -- the OEMs on the vehicle side to kind of release their -- their development schedules, so to speak. So -- so, those are the two major things that we have to look forward to, look at, you know, examine very carefully, and watch very carefully. So, I would say I expect Q2 to be probably a little better than Q1. And then, I expect second half, as I said, particularly in the cyber side, I expect the ARR to return to positive sequentially.\\n\\nPaul Treiber -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Appreciate that. And then, what are your thoughts on your contract extension which is -- which is coming up full-year? I know you've talked about it in the past. If you have anything incremental to say there, would be interested.\\n\\nThanks a lot.\\n\\nPaul Treiber -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nIt's -- it's -- John Chen, it's a little complicated with the AI project. I'm waiting for kind of where the Imperium comes up with, then -- then I will kind of make my own decision of what I wanted to do. But it's all in good hands, so don't -- don't worry about it. And it's -- I told the board let's wait for where the Cylance project is at, and then we'll just make that decision.\\n\\nTim Foote -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nRight. And you'd indicated there was a lot of -- lot of activity around -- around that project. Would you expect it still to take multiyear before you get your initial findings, or can it happen sooner than that?\\n\\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI -- my guess, will take -- you know, because we have a lot of effort going on in, you know, when you -- when you look at separating the business, you have to look at the -- separating the income statement. That's the easy one. Then you have to separate the -- the balance sheet, and then you have to look at the tax side of the equation. And then, you have to look at what the market offer and not offer.\\n\\nAnd, you know, there's a -- there's just a ton of thing that when -- when you cannot just skip it. And so, I still expect this to be full-year-type thing.\\n\\nTim Foote -- CIBC World Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah, OK. Appreciate that color. Thanks a lot.\\n\\nDaniel Chan -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Jim, executive chair and CEO of Investor Relations, for any closing remarks.\\n\\nDaniel Chan -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nI don't have any closing remark. Thank you, everybody, for participating. I'm always confident in the fact that you are in Europe, and -- and then -- you know, it's late for you folks and I appreciate it. So, I'll talk to you guys more and, hopefully, sooner in earlier this month.\\n\\nIf not, at least, our Analyst Day. Thank you all very much.
