They are also all competing in the same global markets, where they face consumer wariness and sometimes regulatory roadblocks.At its event on Wednesday, BYD released a video marking the founding of a dozen rivals from state-run automaker FAW Group in 1956 to commercial EV startups Xpeng(9868.HK), Nio (9866.HK) and Li Auto (2015.HK) in the past decade.The video shows historical footage, sweeping vistas and cars being loaded for export. \"Our stories are different from each other but share the same direction,\" the narrator says, adding in reference to overseas markets: \"There\\'s no distinction between \\'you\\' and \\'me\\'.\"It ends with a call for China\\'s automakers to \"demolish the old legends and achieve new world-class brands,\" under the slogan, \"Chinese Autos\".The video went viral on Chinese social media.

New York-listed shares in Black Spade (BSAQ.A), the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that is merging with VinFast for the listing, jumped 73% to close at $18.50 on Thursday.Shareholders of Hong Kong-based Black Spade (BSAQ.A), VinFast\\'s blank-check partner, voted on Thursday to approve the merger with VinFast.VinFast, in a joint statement with Black Spade, said it would list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol VFS \"on or around August 15\".In July, more than 80% of the shareholders in the SPAC had opted to redeem their shares before the merger.The SPAC merger will not raise new capital for VinFast but the company\\'s founder Pham Nhat Vuong has championed a U.S. listing as the carmaker seeks to expand in the U.S. market and builds a plant in North Carolina.The merger had valued VinFast at $23 billion, the two companies said. In comparison, the current market capitalisation of U.S.-listed EV makers Rivian (RIVN.O) and Lucid (LCID.O) are $21 billion and around $16 billion, respectively.It leaves VinFast\\'s existing shareholders, including parent company Vingroup and Vuong, Vietnam\\'s richest man, with 99% of shares in the company.\"The voting results today are a vote of confidence in VinFast from Black Spade shareholders,\" VinFast\\'s global head Thuy Le said in the statement.VinFast had filed for an initial public offering on the Nasdaq last December, but in May announced plans to list through a merger with Black Spade.Other EV makers including Faraday Future (FFIE.O), Nikola Corp (NKLA.O) and Lucid (LCID.O) have listed via SPAC deals but the market for such deals has faced increased scrutiny from investors and regulators.VinFast has shipped around 3,000 EVs to the United States from its plant in Haiphong, Vietnam. It started to deliver its first VF8 EVs in March. It has not announced U.S. sales figures.Registration data tracked by S&P Global Mobility showed total sales of just 137 VinFast EVs in the United States through June.VinFast\\'s first-quarter revenue dropped 49% from the previous year and it posted a net loss of $598 million. In 2022, the company posted a loss of $2.1 billion. It has not yet made a profit.Vuong, who is also chairman of Vingroup, Vietnam\\'s largest conglomerate, told Vingroup shareholders in May that VinFast expected to sell as many as 50,000 EVs this year and could break even as soon as the end of 2024.The company has previously missed some of its internal delivery targets and faces competition from established rivals led by Tesla (TSLA.O), which have been driving down prices and bringing a range of new EVs to market.Black Spade was founded by the private investment arm of Lawrence Ho, son of the late gambling mogul Stanley Ho.($1 = 23,734.0000 dong)'], ['US opens investigation into fatal Tesla crash in Virginia', 'WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said Thursday they are opening a special crash investigation into a fatal accident in Virginia involving a Tesla Model Y suspected of relying on advanced driver assistance systems and striking a heavy truck.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is probing a July 19 fatal crash in which the driver of a Tesla died after striking a tractor-trailer truck in Warrenton, Virginia.The Fauquier County Sheriff\\'s Office said the 57-year Tesla driver was killed after the tractor trailer was attempting to turn onto a highway from a truck stop. The Tesla struck the side and went underneath the tractor trailer and the driver was pronounced deceased on the scene. The driver of the tractor trailer was issued a summons for reckless driving.Since 2016, the U.S. auto safety regulator has opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to date.Autopilot is a feature intended to steer, accelerate and brake cars automatically within their lane, while enhanced Autopilot can assist in changing lanes on highways. Tesla, which did not respond to requests for comment, says the system requires active human supervision.NHTSA last month opened another special crash probe into a July 5 fatal accident in California involving a 2018 Tesla Model 3. The South Lake Tahoe crash killed the 17-year-old driver of a 2013 Subaru Impreza after a head-on collision with the Tesla Model 3 and fatally injured a three-month-old passenger in the Tesla who died several days later.NHTSA typically opens more than 100 \"special\" crash investigations annually into emerging technologies and other potential auto safety issues that have, for instance, previously helped to develop safety rules on air bags.Those are separate from defect investigations opened by the agency to determine if a safety recall is warranted.In June 2022, NHTSA upgraded to an engineering analysis its defect probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot and crashes with parked emergency vehicles, including fire trucks. The probe was first opened in August 2020.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last month declined to offer an update on the status of the Tesla Autopilot investigation but told Reuters \"we\\'re moving as quickly as we responsibly can.\"'], ['Indonesia gives automakers more time to qualify for EV credits in investment bid', 'TANGERANG, Indonesia, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Thursday it would give automakers two more years to qualify for electric vehicle incentives in Southeast Asia\\'s largest auto market, a move followed by investment commitments by China\\'s Neta EV brand and Mitsubishi Motors.The moves announced at the Jakarta auto show come as Indonesia races Thailand and India to build out an EV industry as an alternative to China, the world’s largest producer.Under the relaxed investment rules announced Thursday, automakers need to commit to producing at least 40% of the content of EVs in Indonesia by 2026 to qualify for incentives, two years later than the initial target. The 40% threshold had been set to encourage local battery production.\"The relaxation on the local content requirement is to attract the investors,\" Indonesia\\'s industry minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita told reporters on the sidelines of the Jakarta auto show.Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest auto market and its second-largest production hub behind Thailand. Toyota (7203.T), its affiliate Daihatsu and Honda (7267.T) account for two-thirds of sales but have been slow to pivot to EVs.Indonesia’s government has set an ambitious target of producing some 600,000 EVs by 2030. That would be more than 100 times the number sold in Indonesia in the first half of 2023.Indonesia had earlier said it would reduce import duties from 50% to zero for EV makers planning investments. That was seen as aimed at attracting Chinese EV makers and potentially Tesla (TSLA.O), a company the government has long courted.“We roll out incentives for all the global carmakers, not for a certain name only,” Agus said.The industry ministry said Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) had committed about $375 million to expand production, including for the Minicab-MiEV electric car. Mitsubishi said production of the EV would start in December.Neta, an EV brand of China\\'s Hozon New Energy Automobile, said it had begun taking orders for the Neta V EV and would start local production in 2024.Until now, only two manufacturers have shifted enough production to Indonesia to qualify for full incentives: Wuling Motors (0305.HK) and Hyundai (005380.KS). Both have factories outside Jakarta and lead the market in EV sales.Wuling offers the cheapest EV on offer in a market where analysts say affordability is one challenge to wider adoption. The Chinese carmaker plans to announce a cheaper version of the Air EV, starting at around $13,200, people familiar with its plans told Reuters.Wuling did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Toyota used its presentation at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show outside Jakarta to showcase locally produced hybrids. Toyota said it would deploy 200 charging stations at dealerships but had not committed to building EVs locally.\"We don\\'t have a concrete plan yet,\" Hiroyuki Ueda, president of Toyota-Astra Motor, a joint-venture between the Japanese carmaker and Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International (ASII.JK), told Reuters.'], ['China EV brand Zeekr to launch its first luxury sports car', \"SHANGHAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - China's Zeekr, Geely Automobile's (0175.HK) electric vehicle brand, said on Thursday it will launch its first luxury sports car, which will be priced above 1 million yuan ($140,000).A person with direct knowledge of the matter added that the company plans to launch the Zeekr 001 FR sports car within weeks and aims to deliver the first batch of cars this year.While Chinese EV makers have ramped up efforts in developing more cost-efficient products facing a brutal price war started by Tesla at the beginning of the year, some of them are also moving upscale to the top segment of high-performance EVs to seek higher margins.BYD launched an electric off-road SUV with a starting price of 1.098 million yuan as the first model under its luxury brand Yangwang in January.Founded in 2021 as a premium EV brand, Zeekr has three models for sales with starting prices ranging from 189,800 yuan to 499,000 yuan.($1 = 7.2116 Chinese yuan renminbi)\"], ['Wall Street ends lower as investors await US inflation data', \"Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, the day after a report showed Americans borrowed more than ever on their credit cards in the last quarter, and a day ahead of U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data that could influence Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.“The markets today are just kind of waffling around.

The company brought staff focused on environmental and legal issues, as well as experts on blasting, water and other technical areas. The informational meeting was a follow-up to a similar one held in 2021.The project, which has divided the county of roughly 230,000 just west of Charlotte, underscores broader tension in the U.S. as those who are resistant to living near a mine clash with those who believe the United States must lessen its dependence on China for lithium and other strategic minerals to cope with climate change.Piedmont first signed a deal to supply lithium to Tesla in 2020 from North Carolina. That deal was paused before being renegotiated in January after Piedmont found a temporary source for the metal from a Quebec lithium mine in which it has an investment. Piedmont\\'s access to that Quebec supply is expected to end by 2026.In Gaston County, Piedmont will need the board to approve a zoning variance before it can build the project. The board has said it will not consider such a change until the company receives a state mining permit. Piedmont has been seeking a permit for nearly two years.Piedmont officials said they would aim to not discharge processed water into local waterways. They added that Piedmont was also open to funding a mine reclamation bond \"much larger\" than the $1 million required by state regulations, though they did not provide a specific amount.Multiple residents spoke against the proposed mine at the meeting. None spoke for it.Piedmont said it thought the meeting went well. \"Our goal was to answer questions and open a dialogue,\" said spokesperson Erin Sanders.Brown, who has been a commissioner since 2010 and is a candidate for North Carolina secretary of state, described the meeting as a \"mixed bag.\"\"I want to be pro-economic development,\" Brown said. \"But I\\'m worried about the environmental impact of the mine and the economic impact after it closes.\"'], [\"China's Li Auto aims to outsell BMW, Mercedes, Audi in its home market in 2024\", 'SHANGHAI, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Li Auto (2015.HK) said it aimed to outsell BMW (BMWG.DE), Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and Audi in China in 2024 as the up and coming Chinese automaker accelerates rollouts of new models and ramps up production.\"We would strive to become the no.1 premium car brand in China in 2024 in terms of sales,\" Li Auto\\'s CEO Li Xiang told investors on Tuesday night, adding that the company could achieve a monthly delivery of 40,000 units in the fourth quarter after a production ramp-up.Founded in 2015, Li Auto will launch its first pure battery electric model MEGA at the end of this year and expects it to be the top-selling model among all cars priced above 500,000 yuan ($69,315) with all types of fuels in China, Li said.The company will launch four new models next year including three EVs, he said.A price war started by Tesla in January had pressured Chinese EV startups like Nio(9866.HK) and Xpeng(9868.HK) to face sales slumps and expanding losses in the first half.But Li Auto managed to gain market share in the segment of cars priced above 300,000 yuan and grow profits this year with four extended-range hybrid vehicles targeting family users.The company posted a positive net income for the third consecutive time in the second quarter, which saw an increase of 147% from the net income in the first quarter.It delivered 173,251 cars in the first seven months of this year, increasing 145% from the same period a year ago. The company targeted to deliver more than 100,000 vehicles in the third quarter.Monthly sales of BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi, which are selling at deep discounts via dealers this year, ranged between 31,500 and 70,000 units, respectively, in the first half, according to data from China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.($1 = 7.2134 Chinese yuan renminbi)'], ['Rivian lifts 2023 EV production target, reassures on liquidity', 'Aug 9 (Reuters) - Rivian Automotive (RIVN.O) on Tuesday raised its full-year production forecast, and its chief executive said the electric vehicle maker has enough money to last it through 2025 as it keeps a lid on costs.Shares in Rivian, which initially rose nearly 3% after results were published, were up 1% in choppy extended trading. The stock has soared nearly 80% in the past three months.The Amazon-backed (AMZN.O) company, like other EV rivals has been burning through cash to ramp up production and keep up with market leader Tesla (TSLA.O), which has slashed prices.Rivian, though, has fared better than smaller firms as demand for its pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles has risen despite high borrowing costs for consumers.The competition and a tight funding environment led two EV firms - Lordstown Motors (RIDEQ.PK) and Proterra (PTRA.O) - to file for bankruptcies in June and this week, respectively.In an interview with Reuters, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said his company was in a far stronger financial position.\"The cash balance that we have today takes us through 2025,\" Scaringe said. \"We will be very thoughtful and intentional on how we secure additional capital to support the growth of the R2 program,\" he added, referring to the company\\'s upcoming lineup of smaller, cheaper cars.Rivian\\'s cash balance fell by nearly $2 billion in the second quarter to $9.26 billion.After struggling to ramp up production because of a shortage of parts such as power semiconductors, Rivian has moved to building in-house Enduro powertrains to cut costs and reduce dependency on suppliers.Scaringe, however, said while supply chain visibility had improved, conditions weren\\'t back to pre-pandemic levels.\"There\\'s always going to be risk associated with supply chain,\" he said. \"That contemplation of that risk is what\\'s informed the guidance that we provided.\"The company on Tuesday said it expected to make 52,000 vehicles in the year, up from its previous forecast of 50,000 units.It posted second-quarter revenue of $1.12 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $1 billion, according to Refinitiv data and reported a smaller quarterly loss. That follows deliveries of 12,640 vehicles in the April-June period, beating analysts\\' estimates of 11,000.Second-quarter gross margins improved to a negative 37%, compared with negative 81% in the first quarter.

Executives from BYD\\'s rivals posted notes of appreciation. \"I feel proud for China’s auto industry!\" said William Li, CEO of Nio on Weibo. \"We should learn from BYD\\'s success.\"\"Salute to BYD!\" said Li Xiang, CEO of Li Auto, who reposted the BYD video. \"Let\\'s give a thumbs up to every participant in the new energy era!\"Other automakers warned the message could raise regulatory risks for Chinese brands overseas, including in Europe, where Chinese EV exports face potential anti-dumping scrutiny.A senior executive of China\\'s Great Wall Motor (601633.SS) shot back that Chinese automakers should embrace the \"reality of competition\".\"At such a critical moment, how can Chinese automakers be together?\" Wang Yuanli, Great Wall Motor\\'s Chief Technology Officer, posted on his social media Weibo account on Friday. \"If we only talk about being together but keep our bitterness in our hearts, it would be better to have the fight first.\"Wang said later he had been quoting a senior editor from China\\'s Auto Business Review.In July, the industry group representing China\\'s automakers retracted a pledge to avoid \"abnormal pricing\" brokered between 16 automakers, including BYD. The China Association of Auto Manufacturers said it recognized the agreement had violated China\\'s antitrust law.In May, Great Wall said it had filed a report with China\\'s regulators against BYD, claiming two top-selling hybrid models did not meet emissions standards. BYD rejected the claim and said it could take legal action.BYD has extended its lead in China\\'s new-energy market, which includes plug-in hybrids and EVs, with a 37% share in the first seven months, up from 29% a year earlier.

New York-listed shares in Black Spade (BSAQ.A), the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that is merging with VinFast for the listing, jumped 73% to close at $18.50 on Thursday.Shareholders of Hong Kong-based Black Spade (BSAQ.A), VinFast\\'s blank-check partner, voted on Thursday to approve the merger with VinFast.VinFast, in a joint statement with Black Spade, said it would list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol VFS \"on or around August 15\".In July, more than 80% of the shareholders in the SPAC had opted to redeem their shares before the merger.The SPAC merger will not raise new capital for VinFast but the company\\'s founder Pham Nhat Vuong has championed a U.S. listing as the carmaker seeks to expand in the U.S. market and builds a plant in North Carolina.The merger had valued VinFast at $23 billion, the two companies said. In comparison, the current market capitalisation of U.S.-listed EV makers Rivian (RIVN.O) and Lucid (LCID.O) are $21 billion and around $16 billion, respectively.It leaves VinFast\\'s existing shareholders, including parent company Vingroup and Vuong, Vietnam\\'s richest man, with 99% of shares in the company.\"The voting results today are a vote of confidence in VinFast from Black Spade shareholders,\" VinFast\\'s global head Thuy Le said in the statement.VinFast had filed for an initial public offering on the Nasdaq last December, but in May announced plans to list through a merger with Black Spade.Other EV makers including Faraday Future (FFIE.O), Nikola Corp (NKLA.O) and Lucid (LCID.O) have listed via SPAC deals but the market for such deals has faced increased scrutiny from investors and regulators.VinFast has shipped around 3,000 EVs to the United States from its plant in Haiphong, Vietnam. It started to deliver its first VF8 EVs in March. It has not announced U.S. sales figures.Registration data tracked by S&P Global Mobility showed total sales of just 137 VinFast EVs in the United States through June.VinFast\\'s first-quarter revenue dropped 49% from the previous year and it posted a net loss of $598 million. In 2022, the company posted a loss of $2.1 billion. It has not yet made a profit.Vuong, who is also chairman of Vingroup, Vietnam\\'s largest conglomerate, told Vingroup shareholders in May that VinFast expected to sell as many as 50,000 EVs this year and could break even as soon as the end of 2024.The company has previously missed some of its internal delivery targets and faces competition from established rivals led by Tesla (TSLA.O), which have been driving down prices and bringing a range of new EVs to market.Black Spade was founded by the private investment arm of Lawrence Ho, son of the late gambling mogul Stanley Ho.($1 = 23,734.0000 dong)'], ['US opens investigation into fatal Tesla crash in Virginia', 'WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said Thursday they are opening a special crash investigation into a fatal accident in Virginia involving a Tesla Model Y suspected of relying on advanced driver assistance systems and striking a heavy truck.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is probing a July 19 fatal crash in which the driver of a Tesla died after striking a tractor-trailer truck in Warrenton, Virginia.The Fauquier County Sheriff\\'s Office said the 57-year Tesla driver was killed after the tractor trailer was attempting to turn onto a highway from a truck stop. The Tesla struck the side and went underneath the tractor trailer and the driver was pronounced deceased on the scene. The driver of the tractor trailer was issued a summons for reckless driving.Since 2016, the U.S. auto safety regulator has opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to date.Autopilot is a feature intended to steer, accelerate and brake cars automatically within their lane, while enhanced Autopilot can assist in changing lanes on highways. Tesla, which did not respond to requests for comment, says the system requires active human supervision.NHTSA last month opened another special crash probe into a July 5 fatal accident in California involving a 2018 Tesla Model 3. The South Lake Tahoe crash killed the 17-year-old driver of a 2013 Subaru Impreza after a head-on collision with the Tesla Model 3 and fatally injured a three-month-old passenger in the Tesla who died several days later.NHTSA typically opens more than 100 \"special\" crash investigations annually into emerging technologies and other potential auto safety issues that have, for instance, previously helped to develop safety rules on air bags.Those are separate from defect investigations opened by the agency to determine if a safety recall is warranted.In June 2022, NHTSA upgraded to an engineering analysis its defect probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot and crashes with parked emergency vehicles, including fire trucks. The probe was first opened in August 2020.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last month declined to offer an update on the status of the Tesla Autopilot investigation but told Reuters \"we\\'re moving as quickly as we responsibly can.\"'], ['Indonesia gives automakers more time to qualify for EV credits in investment bid', 'TANGERANG, Indonesia, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Thursday it would give automakers two more years to qualify for electric vehicle incentives in Southeast Asia\\'s largest auto market, a move followed by investment commitments by China\\'s Neta EV brand and Mitsubishi Motors.The moves announced at the Jakarta auto show come as Indonesia races Thailand and India to build out an EV industry as an alternative to China, the world’s largest producer.Under the relaxed investment rules announced Thursday, automakers need to commit to producing at least 40% of the content of EVs in Indonesia by 2026 to qualify for incentives, two years later than the initial target. The 40% threshold had been set to encourage local battery production.\"The relaxation on the local content requirement is to attract the investors,\" Indonesia\\'s industry minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita told reporters on the sidelines of the Jakarta auto show.Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest auto market and its second-largest production hub behind Thailand. Toyota (7203.T), its affiliate Daihatsu and Honda (7267.T) account for two-thirds of sales but have been slow to pivot to EVs.Indonesia’s government has set an ambitious target of producing some 600,000 EVs by 2030. That would be more than 100 times the number sold in Indonesia in the first half of 2023.Indonesia had earlier said it would reduce import duties from 50% to zero for EV makers planning investments. That was seen as aimed at attracting Chinese EV makers and potentially Tesla (TSLA.O), a company the government has long courted.“We roll out incentives for all the global carmakers, not for a certain name only,” Agus said.The industry ministry said Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) had committed about $375 million to expand production, including for the Minicab-MiEV electric car. Mitsubishi said production of the EV would start in December.Neta, an EV brand of China\\'s Hozon New Energy Automobile, said it had begun taking orders for the Neta V EV and would start local production in 2024.Until now, only two manufacturers have shifted enough production to Indonesia to qualify for full incentives: Wuling Motors (0305.HK) and Hyundai (005380.KS). Both have factories outside Jakarta and lead the market in EV sales.Wuling offers the cheapest EV on offer in a market where analysts say affordability is one challenge to wider adoption. The Chinese carmaker plans to announce a cheaper version of the Air EV, starting at around $13,200, people familiar with its plans told Reuters.Wuling did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Toyota used its presentation at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show outside Jakarta to showcase locally produced hybrids. Toyota said it would deploy 200 charging stations at dealerships but had not committed to building EVs locally.\"We don\\'t have a concrete plan yet,\" Hiroyuki Ueda, president of Toyota-Astra Motor, a joint-venture between the Japanese carmaker and Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International (ASII.JK), told Reuters.'], ['China EV brand Zeekr to launch its first luxury sports car', \"SHANGHAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - China's Zeekr, Geely Automobile's (0175.HK) electric vehicle brand, said on Thursday it will launch its first luxury sports car, which will be priced above 1 million yuan ($140,000).A person with direct knowledge of the matter added that the company plans to launch the Zeekr 001 FR sports car within weeks and aims to deliver the first batch of cars this year.While Chinese EV makers have ramped up efforts in developing more cost-efficient products facing a brutal price war started by Tesla at the beginning of the year, some of them are also moving upscale to the top segment of high-performance EVs to seek higher margins.BYD launched an electric off-road SUV with a starting price of 1.098 million yuan as the first model under its luxury brand Yangwang in January.Founded in 2021 as a premium EV brand, Zeekr has three models for sales with starting prices ranging from 189,800 yuan to 499,000 yuan.($1 = 7.2116 Chinese yuan renminbi)\"], ['Wall Street ends lower as investors await US inflation data', \"Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, the day after a report showed Americans borrowed more than ever on their credit cards in the last quarter, and a day ahead of U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data that could influence Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.“The markets today are just kind of waffling around.

The company brought staff focused on environmental and legal issues, as well as experts on blasting, water and other technical areas. The informational meeting was a follow-up to a similar one held in 2021.The project, which has divided the county of roughly 230,000 just west of Charlotte, underscores broader tension in the U.S. as those who are resistant to living near a mine clash with those who believe the United States must lessen its dependence on China for lithium and other strategic minerals to cope with climate change.Piedmont first signed a deal to supply lithium to Tesla in 2020 from North Carolina. That deal was paused before being renegotiated in January after Piedmont found a temporary source for the metal from a Quebec lithium mine in which it has an investment. Piedmont\\'s access to that Quebec supply is expected to end by 2026.In Gaston County, Piedmont will need the board to approve a zoning variance before it can build the project. The board has said it will not consider such a change until the company receives a state mining permit. Piedmont has been seeking a permit for nearly two years.Piedmont officials said they would aim to not discharge processed water into local waterways. They added that Piedmont was also open to funding a mine reclamation bond \"much larger\" than the $1 million required by state regulations, though they did not provide a specific amount.Multiple residents spoke against the proposed mine at the meeting. None spoke for it.Piedmont said it thought the meeting went well. \"Our goal was to answer questions and open a dialogue,\" said spokesperson Erin Sanders.Brown, who has been a commissioner since 2010 and is a candidate for North Carolina secretary of state, described the meeting as a \"mixed bag.\"\"I want to be pro-economic development,\" Brown said. \"But I\\'m worried about the environmental impact of the mine and the economic impact after it closes.\"'], [\"China's Li Auto aims to outsell BMW, Mercedes, Audi in its home market in 2024\", 'SHANGHAI, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Li Auto (2015.HK) said it aimed to outsell BMW (BMWG.DE), Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) and Audi in China in 2024 as the up and coming Chinese automaker accelerates rollouts of new models and ramps up production.\"We would strive to become the no.1 premium car brand in China in 2024 in terms of sales,\" Li Auto\\'s CEO Li Xiang told investors on Tuesday night, adding that the company could achieve a monthly delivery of 40,000 units in the fourth quarter after a production ramp-up.Founded in 2015, Li Auto will launch its first pure battery electric model MEGA at the end of this year and expects it to be the top-selling model among all cars priced above 500,000 yuan ($69,315) with all types of fuels in China, Li said.The company will launch four new models next year including three EVs, he said.A price war started by Tesla in January had pressured Chinese EV startups like Nio(9866.HK) and Xpeng(9868.HK) to face sales slumps and expanding losses in the first half.But Li Auto managed to gain market share in the segment of cars priced above 300,000 yuan and grow profits this year with four extended-range hybrid vehicles targeting family users.The company posted a positive net income for the third consecutive time in the second quarter, which saw an increase of 147% from the net income in the first quarter.It delivered 173,251 cars in the first seven months of this year, increasing 145% from the same period a year ago.

The stock has soared nearly 80% in the past three months.The Amazon-backed (AMZN.O) company, like other EV rivals has been burning through cash to ramp up production and keep up with market leader Tesla (TSLA.O), which has slashed prices.Rivian, though, has fared better than smaller firms as demand for its pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles has risen despite high borrowing costs for consumers.The competition and a tight funding environment led two EV firms - Lordstown Motors (RIDEQ.PK) and Proterra (PTRA.O) - to file for bankruptcies in June and this week, respectively.In an interview with Reuters, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said his company was in a far stronger financial position.\"The cash balance that we have today takes us through 2025,\" Scaringe said. \"We will be very thoughtful and intentional on how we secure additional capital to support the growth of the R2 program,\" he added, referring to the company\\'s upcoming lineup of smaller, cheaper cars.Rivian\\'s cash balance fell by nearly $2 billion in the second quarter to $9.26 billion.After struggling to ramp up production because of a shortage of parts such as power semiconductors, Rivian has moved to building in-house Enduro powertrains to cut costs and reduce dependency on suppliers.Scaringe, however, said while supply chain visibility had improved, conditions weren\\'t back to pre-pandemic levels.\"There\\'s always going to be risk associated with supply chain,\" he said. \"That contemplation of that risk is what\\'s informed the guidance that we provided.\"The company on Tuesday said it expected to make 52,000 vehicles in the year, up from its previous forecast of 50,000 units.It posted second-quarter revenue of $1.12 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $1 billion, according to Refinitiv data and reported a smaller quarterly loss.
